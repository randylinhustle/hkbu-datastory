        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-1">China talent show has once boomed when ‘Super Girl’ (超级女声) aired in year 2005. Unlike those typical professional singing competitions, Super Girl emphasizes the contestant's personal characteristics instead of merely their singing professionality. It is also the first talent show in China to add the element of audience engagement by allowing the audience to vote for their idol by sending text messages. By then, the fate of idols lie in the hands of their fans - the contestant with lowest vote will be eliminated while the contestant with the highest vote will finally be the leader of the idol group. Li Yuchun, the champion of the first season Super Girl won a total of 3.5 million votes by the time people had to pay 1 RMB for each voting message.&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-1">After the Super Girl wave, China talent shows went off the air for a period of time and made a comeback two years ago with a stronger wave. The talent show ‘Idol Producer’ (偶像练习生) produced by AiQiYi got 100 million views within an hour on its first online broadcast. The full series of the show garnered over 2.7 billion views in three months, meaning more than 250 million views on every single episode. Cai Xukun, has become the champion of the show and the leader of the boy group, Nine Percent, by receiving a staggering amount of 47 million votes in the final.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Later that year, in the female version of the show produced by Tencent, Meng Meiqi has got 180 million votes to become the champion of ‘Produce 101’ (创造101). While Curley G, the champion of CHUANG2020 (创造营2020) got 250 million votes in the show, marking a highest vote received in the China’s talent show history.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-2">These votes do not merely come from the normal voting system, in which everybody has the same and certain amount of votes to vote for their idol. However, according to the “Detailed Rules on the content Review Standards for Online Variety Show” issued by the China State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, talent shows producers are forbidden to set up a ‘pay to vote’ section, meaning it is illegal to sell votes to the audiences.<br>
          <br>Instead of selling votes, the show producers and sponsors have used a lot of different strategies to allow the audiences to “change cash into votes”.&nbsp;

                    <span style="font-weight: normal;">“Teng Xun has this customized member card that costs 18 RMB, which is more expensive than the normal member card. But you can get another 121 votes if you purchase that card,” Liu added. She then spent 1080 RMB purchasing 60 cards to vote for Meng Meiqi which makes her a Teng Xun member until year 2024.</span>

        </p>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-2">
          Zhong Hua brand toothpaste, which is one of the sponsorship of Produce 101, has experienced a 268% e-commerce sales surge after two months of the show exposure. Another sponsor, Kang Shi Fu official data shows that more than 100 million of Kang Shi Fu iced black tea have been sold during May 2020, which was the time that the show was being broadcasted, indicating a 40% year-on-year growth.<br>
          <br>Again, this happens because audiences could get extra votes by buying the sponsors’ products. “The fans now are more wealthy than the past fans,” said Miki Lau, a Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) lecturer studying fan culture. “Fans' economic market is boosting, mainly because there are more ways for people to make money with the development of technology. Young people do sales and become KOL online to earn a side income,” Miki believes that the companies are aware of the empowerment of fans and made good use of it to gain money from them. </br>

                    During the broadcast of CHUANG2020 and another China talent show, Youth With You 2, “drink milk to earn votes (喝奶赚票)”, becomes a new term between the fans circle.<br>
                    <br>“People don’t buy MengNiu Just Yogurt (蒙牛纯甄小蛮腰) to drink, they just want to scan the QR code on the bottle cap to get extra votes for their idol, we called this ‘milk votes (奶票)’,” said Victoria Wong, a fan supporiting her idol on CHUANG2020.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>Meng Niu Just Yogurt is the title sponsor of CHUANG2020, scanning the QR code on the yogurt drink’s bottle cap could earn 4 more votes for a single idol. “I have scanned more than 400 milk votes at the time,” Wong added.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>“The more you buy, the more votes you get, the larger possibility for your idol to get a higher ranking,” said Wong. These fans spared no expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <br>Wong is responsible for the income and expenditure of the fund raised by the fan club on platform like OWhat and Taoba (桃吧). As a die-hard fan of Zen, Wong told me not to reveal her idol’s real name to prevent bringing a negative impact on Zen.</br>

          <br>“The funds are not only for milk votes purchasing, but will also be used for other expenses, such as buying other accounts to massively vote for the idol or renting a Tencent video account to increase the idol’s popularity,” said Wong.<br>

                  <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-1">The crowdfunding later became a common phenomenon in the fans circle. “I did not want to put in that much money at first, but the fans group will kind of put pressure on you, makes you feel that if your idol did not reach the top, it is all on you because you did not put in enough money to vote for her,” Liu recalled. “Then you will automatically put in more and more money to not disappoint her (Meng Meiqi),” she added. It is like a loop.<br>
                    <br>“If you are in a group, but you are not contributing much enough, that is the matter, you will feel being left out of the community,” Miki Lau, a Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) lecturer studying on fans culture concur to Liu statement.

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-1">"I know its an unfair game, I just can't help myself"</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Despite the enormous effort paid by the fans to pave their idols’ success road, “Most of the talent shows are not completely fair,” said Miki. “The voting systems are not transparent. Not everyone knows the mechanism behind the counting system.”<br>
          <br>Liu supported Miki’s statement with her own experience. “We all know this is a capital game, our idols are the characters in it. But if we put in more money, they will earn more resources and opportunities in the game. So we willingly did that. Because we just love them so much, we want them to become a better person.”&nbsp;<br>
          <br>“The show is a production, the producer is creating a sense of excitement to attract audiences by including the voting system. But if everything depends on the audience's vote, the production will be out of control and they might fail to control the possible outcome,” Miki explained the reasons behind the ‘fake’ voting system. “Most of the fans are aware of it but they still voluntarily put in money to show their support.”<br>
          <br>“I dont care whose pockets the money ends up in, I will still pay to support her. Only if her fan base wields the strength of building a stage can she be seen by the world,” Wong holds a similar thought as Liu.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Miki explained the fans' mental activities under her fans study experience, “This could be considered as a parasocial relationship among the fans and their idol,” Miki added, “Once the relationship has been built up, which could be a virtual relationship, the fans will find some kind of reasons and attachment to make them feel they have the responsibility to support their idols. They will have a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction watching their idol succeed.”&nbsp;<br>

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-1">The Moral and Legal Boundaries</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2" style="margin-bottom: 60px;;">
          “Crowdfunding activities may be considered in the grey zone area or even illegal,” said Sophie Shao, a fan of Li Jiaqi who is one of the idols in the talent show Youth with You 2. “This is also why the term ‘crowdfunding (集资)’ will be blocked on Weibo and people normally use the an orange emoji (橘子) as an alternative,” she explained. <br>
          <br>CCTV has once criticized the fans group’s crowdfunding behaviour. “So even if it is not completely illegal, this is something negative at the national level. An idol’s future could be ruined once he was caught as a model for this negative behaviour,” said Shao. “So even though it is something that everybody is doing in the fans circle, it is always not a thing to be put and discuss openly on the table,” Shao added. <br>
          <br>However, Li Anan, doctor of economic law who currently teaches in Wuhan University law school, said that “this kind of fan’s crowdfunding behaviour would not be considered as illegal fundraising.”<br>
          <br>“The fans group which set up the crowdfunding did not promise any money, shares or physical reward to the funder, so it is hard to define this as fund-raising, let alone illegal fund-raising,” Li Anan replied in text messages. “The crowdfunding activity can be regarded as a civil contract between fans and the fans group. The fans group shall fulfill its obligation to use the fund raised for the known purpose of fans, meaning buying votes and use on other activities that could benefit their idol,” Li added.<br>
          <br>There is a high transparency of the crowdfunding expenditure disclosure under the current circumstances. Under the premise of high convergence of interest, a detailed account of the fund will be provided by the fans group administrators to build mutual trust between the fans and fans group. <br>

                    <span style="font-weight: normal;">“But the real problem is that these fans groups are raising more and more funds, often millions or even up to ten million. Human nature may not stand such a big test,” said Li. “This is the reason why problems like making false disclosure about the use of funds or even fans groups absconded with money commonly happened, ” Li Anan believes that the information disclosure is an eternal problem between the two parties with inconsistent interests and asymmetric information acquisition.<br>
                      <br>“Since the public power is not involved in such civil juristic acts, it is difficult to investigate these wrongdoings unless the fans are able to collect enough evidence to pursue criminal responsibility. However, it is quite difficult to do so,” said Li.

                            Sun Han’s Hong Kong business was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. She founded her
                            company, Dear Booklet, a year ago, selling high-end personal photo albums processed using
                            artificial intelligence. However, her overseas supplier was unable to start
                            working until April this year on account of the unprecedented situation.

                            As of November 2020, Hong Kong has gone through three waves of COVID-19, in response to
                            which the government has issued <a
                                href="https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/anti-epidemic-fund.html">three rounds of
                                “Anti-epidemic” funds</a> to relieve economic pressure and support local business. The
                            <a href="https://www.ess.gov.hk/en/">Employment Support Scheme (“ESS”)</a> is the highlight
                            of the second round of funding, offering time-limited subsidies to employers and helping
                            them pay their employees.

                            “Since we are a start-up, we are too young to meet the selection criteria of those
                            supporting schemes for enterprises from the government,” said Sun, whose company had not
                            received any subsidies from the ESS or other support schemes. “The first challenge
                            is that we got obstructed in promotional activities because of the social gathering ban,”
                            she explained. “All onsite activities had to be cancelled. We even couldn’t visit our
                            clients.” She noted that, because many retail SMEs
                            face high storage fees and rents, for start-ups, “It’s hard to survive without monthly
                            income.” Sun suggested that the government should reduce or waive site fees, such as those
                            for office rentals and storage.

                            product suppliers have suffered from the epidemic as well. They suspended production, so we
                            can’t get the products on time.”

                            conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in August 2020 indicated that they
                            could not survive for more than six months without
                            further relief measures from the government. The challenges currently confronting these
                            firms include business partners’ financial difficulties, unpredictable foreign sanctions,
                            insufficient cash flows and business volumes,

                            <br> Wonderkin, a local start-up founded in 2019 and based at Cyberport that sells smart
                            diaper products, has also encountered problems in its supply chain as a result of the
                            pandemic. “Because of COVID-19, all of our partners,
                            especially in the healthcare industry—their focus went to medical supply, you know, personal
                            protection equipment, like masks, ventilators, gloves for people who work,” said Fiona Li,
                            the CEO and co-founder of Wonderkin.


                            <br>
                            <br> However, the company has benefitted from several schemes offered by the government.
                            “The government has the <a
                                href="https://www.itf.gov.hk/en/funding-programmes/nurturing-talent/stem-internship-scheme/">STEM
                                Internship Program</a> Program that subsidises companies that hire students who are
                            taking STEM programs,” she continued. “I’m able to get some of the students into the
                            program, so that helps me to speed up the development process.”

                            <br>
                            <br> She had also heard about the <a href="https://fast.cyberport.hk/en/apply">FinTech
                                Anti-epidemic Scheme for Talent Development (FAST)</a> initiative launched by the Hong
                            Kong Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau,
                            which offers salary subsidies to participating employers of up to $10,000HKD monthly for a
                            maximum of 12 months during the period from July 2020 to July 2022. She was uncertain about
                            the success rate of the applications that
                            were submitted, but it was her understanding that “if you can prove your company is a
                            fintech company, they give it out to you.”

                            <br>
                            <br> Besides the ESS and FAST, the Hong Kong government also offers 100% loan guarantees to
                            SMEs under the <a
                                href="http://www.hkmc.com.hk/eng/our_business/sme_financing_guarantee_scheme.html">SME
                                Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS)</a>.
                            It has increased its initial loan guarantee commitment from $20 billion to $50 billion as
                            part of the effort to ease the burden on borrowers and also increased the maximum amount for
                            the loans and the repayment period. The
                            352 respondents to the Impact of COVID-19 on Business Operations survey conducted by the
                            Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in early May 2020—more than half of whom were involved
                            with SMEs—gave the 100% loan guarantee scheme
                            an average score of 2.9 on an ascending scale of usefulness ranging from 1 to 5.




                        </p>


                        <p>

                            The effectiveness of the loan guarantee scheme may, however, be time-limited. “Loans can
                            only solve the problem for a while. The important thing for a business is to have business,”
                            said Hilton Chan, an adjunct professor at Hong Kong University of Science
                            and Technology’s Business School. He was of the opinion that no amount of money supplied by
                            the government to individuals would be of much help as long as the economy is closed and
                            people are under quarantine, for which reason
                            “The most important thing is basically to open up [the economy].”

                            <br>

                            <br> As for SMEs’ concerns about rents, Chan pointed out that many business owners “have to
                            consider whether they can downsize their offices.” Having witnessed a transformation in the
                            workplace over the past six months as many
                            employees began working from home, he pondered, “Why do we need to pay high rent for our
                            office?”



                            <br>

                            <br> COVID-19 has also impacted SMEs in Singapore, where the government has issued a series
                            of support schemes to help business owners, including the <a
                                href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Businesses/Jobs-Support-Scheme--JSS-/">Job
                                Supporting Scheme (JSS)</a> and <a

                                Enterprise Financing Scheme</a>. Similar to the ESS in Hong Kong, the
                            JSS offers employers wage support to help them retain local employees, and the enhanced
                            Enterprise Financing Scheme is Singapore’s version of Hong Kong’s SFGS, both having been
                            designed to increase the scale of the current
                            loan guarantee plan for SMEs.

                            At least one expert in Singapore has also questioned the long-term efficacy of such loan
                            guarantee schemes. David Leong, managing director of the human resource consulting company
                            PeopleWorldwide Consulting, warned that “the government cannot go on providing
                            JSS across the board, as it will deplete the coffers and, most importantly, distort
                            employment conditions.” He went on to indicate that Singaporeans need to adapt to the new
                            circumstances, including by working from home and
                            teleconferencing.

                        </p>



                        <p>
                            However, it may be no easy task for some companies to move their business online.
                            “Digitalisation costs money,” said Johnson, the owner of a construction SME in Singapore. He
                            suggested that the situation might be tolerable if the technology for dealing
                            with the pandemic, such as monitoring systems for body temperature, were ready to use upon
                            delivery. Such measures as installing enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that
                            allows companies to work online, though, could
                            cost hundreds of thousands of Singapore dollars.


                            <br>
                            <br> Johnson was also facing problems with his supply chain. Before the pandemic, his
                            manufacturers assembled materials in China or Malaysia and then transported them to
                            Singapore for further processing. “Now, the manufacturers
                            in Malaysia are not producing,” he complained. “As the situation with the pandemic worsens,
                            the Malaysian government locks the country down, and things can’t be transported.”


                            <br>
                            <br> He founded his construction company in Singapore in 2008 and had benefitted from the
                            government’s financial support during the pandemic in the form of levy relief, loan
                            guarantees, and a one-off grant.



                            <br>
                            <br> The Singapore government also offered legal protections to the businesses and
                            properties of local SMEs by issuing the six-month-effective <a
                                href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/COVID19TMA2020">COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act
                                2020</a>.
                            The act prohibits the bringing of insolvency proceedings against SMEs by either their
                            creditors or financing companies. In order to recover from the pandemic, SMEs may need more
                            lasting support. Thus, Johnson hoped that the
                            government would extend the due date for the reduction of the levy.




                            <br>

                            <br> It was his observation that, though the government offered numerous support policies
                            and forms of funding, it only did so after people had felt pain. “The government has put up
                            a lot of money, but citizens get little of
                            it in the end,” he concluded, suggesting that it should make pro-active policies rather than
                            waiting until disaster struck.

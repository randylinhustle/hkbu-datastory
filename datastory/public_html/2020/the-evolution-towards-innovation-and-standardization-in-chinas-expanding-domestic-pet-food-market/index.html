					industry in China, <br>long
					dominated
					by imports, has been changing. In order to sustain their success,<br> Chinese pet food firms

						Taffee is the first milk tea made for pets to be sold in China. Lanxi Huang, an authentic
						“post-95s girl” born in Xi’an, founded the brand in 2018 after graduating from college in
						Australia.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						Huang said that, while studying overseas, she grew accustomed to ordering milk tea after coming
						home from work late at night since the high sugar content cheered her up. However, her dog,
						named Taifei, having kept her company through the years, could only watch her enjoy the tea but
						could not consume a beverage made for humans. Then it struck her that pets could have their own
						kind of milk tea.
					</p>
					<h4 style="font-size: 22px; font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">“I had a strong sense of
						mission pushing me to make a special type of
						pet drink to bring happiness to my dog,” said Lanxi Huang.</h4>

					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						In China, no drinks for household pets were on the market, so Huang was a pioneer in creating
						her brand. She combined the trendy concept of milk tea with pet food in an innovative way. At
						first, curiosity drew pet owners to Taffee.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						Compared with such brands of milk tea as Miocha and Wocha—designed for humans—the ingredients in
						Taffee are similar, with nutrition in the form of goat milk powder mixed with water.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						There were already some products on the market designed to render pets’ dry food more palatable
						and entice finicky pets—mainly cats—to drink more water or ordinary milk. However, Taffee is
						intended, not to meet pets’ physiological needs, but to be a fun bonding experience for pets and
						their owners.
					</p>
					<h4 style="font-size: 22px; font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						In Huang’s words, “What we hope to achieve is to create a sense of happiness and cater to the
						emotional needs of pets.”
					</h4>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						The popularity of Taffee proves that Huang has her finger on the pulse of contemporary social
						trends in China. Herself a member of Generation Z (born between 1995 and 2015), she knows that
						young people today are no longer satisfied with ordinary products but are attracted to those
						with clever packaging and distinctive characteristics. Generation Z pet owners, she realized,
						buy pet snacks not only as treats for their animal companions but also as objects endowed with a
						social meaning that can be disseminated through social media.

					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						Although the members of Generation Z are gradually exerting ever more purchasing power in the
						pet food products market, they currently make up only a small proportion of China’s pet owners
						(5.6% according to a recent study). Members of the Post-80s generation remain the largest bloc
						of consumers of pet food products and are also more inclined to consider cost over packaging
						when making purchases.

					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						According to Huang, the pet food market is becoming increasingly diversified and differentiated
						in China. These circumstances, as she saw it, were creating opportunities for domestic brands to
						market innovative products designed to capitalize on the latest social trends and respond to the
						attitudes of Chinese young people.

					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						In 2019, pet food accounted for 61.4% of the overall consumption structure in the Chinese pet
						industry, far more than other categories of pet products, including medicines and beauty care.
						Among the various food subcategories, pet snacks and drinks accounted for 31.1% of consumption,
						while staple food accounted for 67.7%, suggesting that most of the economic potential for
						domestic pet products is in this segment of the market.

						Joyzone is an example of a domestic brand offering high-quality pet staple food. Tara Zhang, the
						company’s founder and CEO, started her business only two months ago, after resigning from a
						position with Zhen Fund.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						Zhang spoke of the difficulties involved with producing innovative and distinctive products in
						the pet staple food market. Unlike niche areas of the market such as pet drinks, pet staple food
						is already a mature and stable product with well-established manufacturing processes and
						international standards. Therefore, instead of following social trends, which are usually
						ephemeral, she preferred to put her efforts into guaranteeing the high quality of every single
						batch of Joyzone’s pet food.

						However, when it comes to this segment of the market, pet owners in China tend to place their
						trust in imported products.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						Huilin Zhou is a fourth-year student at Hong Kong Baptist University who unexpectedly adopted a
						cat in Wuhan Province last year.
					</p>
					<h4 style="font-size: 22px; font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						“Nowadays, the products for cats are much more advanced and expensive than they used to be,” she
						observed.
					</h4>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						When choosing what her cat ate and drank, she said, she paid close attention to the nutrition
						and ingredients contained in various products. After listening to suggestions from people with
						considerable feline experience and comparing several brands herself, she decided to buy the most
						expensive imported pet staple food available in China, priced at around 520RMB per bag.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						In fact, during the “Double 11” e-commerce event in 2019, the most popular imported product was
						cat staple food. Among the five most popular imported brands, PETCUREAN GO! and Orijaen, both
						Canadian companies, ranked third and fourth, respectively. As statistics from Huaon suggest, pet
						owners in China’s first- and second-tier cities in particular prefer imported cat food over
						domestic brands.
					</p>
					<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4568622">
						<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
					</div>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						From the beginning of 2015 to April 2020, 1,031 SKUs (stock-keeping units) of imported pet foods
						were newly registered or renewed by China’s Ministry of Agriculture. In the first quarter of
						2020, the number of foreign pet companies registered with the minister reached a monthly high of
						315 SKUs. These statistics reflect the increasingly fierce competition between imported and
						domestic brands in this market sector.
					</p>

					<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4568631" data-height="520px"

						<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
					</div>

					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						Most domestic Chinese pet food brands have positioned themselves to cater to the middle- and
						low-end consumer market so that their profits are dependent on minimizing production costs,
						which means using inferior ingredients and loosening quality control standards. As a
						consequence, consumers have come to distrust the safety of domestic pet food, and imported
						brands have dominated the Chinese market.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						Zhang of Joyzone also asserted that misleading marketing strategies were duping consumers into
						accepting unscientific notions about pet care. In order to cater to some consumers’ demands for
						products that enhance the appearance of their pets, for instance, some domestic companies even
						claimed that their food could make pets have more flesh on cheeks, though products with this
						function may harm the health of pets.

					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						Despite Chinese consumers’ faith in imported pet food, these products may show unevenness in
						quality from batch to batch. Zhang mentioned that a friend whose pet developed a kidney ailment
						after being fed one imported pet food brand during the pandemic had inspired her to start her
						own staple food brand.
					</p>
					<h4 style="font-size: 22px; font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						“I understand that the supply chain in China is already mature enough,” she said. “However,
						domestic consumers need to be educated in order to be more receptive to domestic brands.”
					</h4>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						To enhance the regulation of China’s fast-growing pet food market, the Ministry of Agriculture
						announced in September 2019 a new policy, the Pet Feed Management Measure. Previously, there had
						been no specific rules governing the manufacture and distribution of pet food, a lack that was
						in part responsible for the quality issues with domestic brands.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:'Georgia', Times, serif">
						“I believe that, with the introduction of more regulations and rules, the industry will
						gradually trend towards production specialization and market standardization,” Zhang concluded,
						“I also expect domestic pet food products to surpass imported ones in the future.”

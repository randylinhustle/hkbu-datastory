graduates’ worries were not unfounded. The Hong Kong branch of L’Oréal, the
French personal care company, has slowed hiring and increased the standards for
job candidates.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>“For
retail positions, like customer service, we have already stopped hiring. Also,
we have reduced by 90% our six-month and one-year internship programs this
year,” said Megan Tang, the company’s assistant talent acquisition manager. “We
don’t reduce the starting salary, but we set higher requirements for the candidates.
Previously, you just needed to have sales-based knowledge to work in a sales
position. Now, you need to be able to learn on the job and to adapt quickly to
the fast-changing environment and the company’s requirements.”<br>
              <br><b>[2]</b>&nbsp;Julio Orr, the founder and CEO of Happyer, an online career
navigation platform, described the situation in stark terms. “There has been an
approximate 50% drop in vacancies on our company’s platform compared with what we
would have expected in a normal employment environment.”<br>
              <br> He explained that, as a result, his company had altered its recruitment methods.
“Instead of hiring graduates full-time, our company has created a lot of unpaid
internship opportunities for students during the summer.” He described this
shift as a way “to ease the company’s internal pressure and offer students a
chance to gain experience in the workplace at the same time.”<br>

            <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-5"><b>[3]</b>&nbsp;In contrast with the
dismal traditional employment environment, the gig economy—the free market
system characterized by temporary arrangements between organizations and independent
workers—has been creating new opportunities for recent graduates.<br>
              <br> Thus, since its greatest impact has been a
general shift toward online interactions, according to Dr. Chandra Yanto of Hong
Kong Polytechnic University, “the pandemic has accelerated the trend toward the
gig economy, caused the digital labor market to boom, and provided more chances
for freelancers and people wanting to seek alternative opportunities.”<br>
              <br> “Workers are being laid off in the restructuring
companies. People have to survive. One of the easiest ways is going online,” he
added. “People’s online activities are increasing during the pandemic.
Entrepreneurs sell their expertise and skills online, comedians create Youtube
channels, teachers start offering online tutorials, and so on.”<br>
              <br> Moreover, he said that young people should not feel
anxious about the situation since anyone can pick up new skills online that increase
his or her competitiveness on the job market.

            <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-3">Not surprisingly, students are seeking
help finding work under these unprecedented conditions. Thus, HKBU’s career
center reported a 50% increase in the number of students seeking career
counseling this year over 2019.<br>
              <br> Angelina Chan, the center’s career development manager, observed that, “Because
of the impact of the pandemic, enterprises have begun to adopt the mode of
mixed virtual and physical internships, in which flexibility and problem-solving
ability are more important than had been the case. On top of the challenges involved
with acquiring additional competencies, there has also been a relative increase
in employers’ expectations of graduates owing to resource constraints.”<br>
              <br> “The number of vacancies is down, but the government and companies are also
taking measures to help graduates find employment, so the situation is not too
gloomy,” said Chan. “HKBU has set up Project SEED [Student Engagement,
Enrichment, and Development], through which it works with alumni and supporters
to offer a range of educational opportunities that enhance students’ personal
attributes and readiness for careers.”

with skills applicable to surveying, town planning, engineering, research, and assisting
executives.<br>
              <br> The government is also expected to recruit more
than 10,000 civil servants this year to fill either vacancies resulting from retirements
or newly created posts. Some 6,000 of these new posts will open over the coming
year for the purpose of enhancing the provision of existing services. &nbsp;Further, there are plans to recruit some 5,000
short-term interns this year, an increase of around 3,000 over last year.<br>
              <br> Although the government has been doing its best
to manage the pandemic, “there is a danger of spending too much on helping the
employment environment,” Dr. Chandra asserted.<br>
              <br> “Doing too much will put a serious burden on the
government’s budget and may cause a deficit in the following years, in turn
causing the government to reduce public and social service expenditures.”

                    Cherry Wong got a taste of how horrible the coronavirus was with symptoms of infections, fever,
                    malaise, dry cough, and shortness of breath when she had to go back to her hometown from the UK as
                    an exchange student in the middle of a pandemic.

                    Cherry, 21, studying at the Hong Kong Baptist University who majors in communication. She
                    participated in a school exchange program before the deadly outbreak, "In the beginning, I
                    considered that this terrible infectious disease only spread in Asia, so I did not pay too much
                    attention to what would happen in Britain before studying abroad," she traveled to the UK as an
                    international student in the second semester from January 2020, "I thought I had escaped to a safer
                    place, but this is not the case."

                    "Even until late March, there were still not many people wearing masks," Cherry recalled that local
                    people around did not have much awareness or measures for epidemic prevention. While walking on the
                    street with masks put on, Cherry and her friend were being pointed and scolded by the "Coronavirus"
                    or "Asian" by local people. Some people pretended to cough and sneeze in front of them.

                    But the campus closures have created a much greater calamity in the lives of international students
                    like Cherry. As shopping malls and most public facilities were shuttered at that time, most of the
                    other students had stopped the exchange program. Cherry finally decided to come back. Wearing
                    protection clothes, goggles, and masks that were brought from Amazon, Cherry and her friends
                    traveled back to Hong Kong from Scotland, transferred by Doha.

                    The United Kingdom and Hong Kong have comparable medical systems to a certain extent, David
                    Nicholson, chief executive of NHS England, said when he was attending the Hong Kong Hospital
                    Authority's annual conference.

                <p class="lead">
                    While there are similar systems in both places, Cherry claimed to have returned to the so-called
                    familiar hometown where there was a medical system that had protected her for 21 years. But this
                    time, can she still get protection safely?

                    Hong Kong was among the first regions outside of mainland China to recognize the COVID-19 outbreak
                    as a public emergency - doing so on 25 January, two days after the city confirmed its first two
                    cases. But the government had begun preparation for incoming infection as early as 31 December.

                    introduce new laws that would qualify the unidentified virus as a "notifiable" disease, giving the
                    government the right to quarantine suspected cases.

                <p class="lead">
                    Vanessa Fong, a year-3 film student at Hong Kong Baptist University, did the test for COVID-19
                    infection after returning from Aberystwyth, Wales as an exchange student. Transferred by Dubai from
                    Wales, she arrived in Hong Kong and left the airport by handing in a health declaration form and
                    starting her quarantine. On the last day of her quarantine period, she felt a headache and sore
                    throat and called an ambulance to the temporary test centre at AsiaWord-Expo.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    "The time when I was waiting for the result is tough," said Vanessa. During the 9-hour waiting in
                    AsiaWorld-Expo, she wore all protection gear she could have as she believed it was a high-risk
                    infection place. "About three hundred people were waiting for results at the same place. I felt
                    annoyed when some of the others kept walking around intentionally, and some even didn't wear a
                    mask."

                <p class="lead">
                    According to the testing centre regulations, people can take off the mask only when eating, and
                    masks cannot be removed at other times, including sleeping. People cannot go around at any time
                    except for necessary needs like going to the washroom. But there were no specific penalties or
                    monitoring stated.

                    "I traveled back to the hotel I stayed at by public transportations while I was still quarantining
                    at that time." After being tested negative to the virus, Vanessa wasn't instructed on anyways of
                    leaving AsiaWorld-Expo that public transportations were the only way she could take. A similar
                    situation happened when she arrived in Hong Kong. There is no tracking on the way from the airport
                    to the quarantine address, which could be a hotel or home.

                <p class="lead">
                    There were cases where residents discovered people who wore wristbands walking around on the
                    streets. Chuang Shuk-Kwan, head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the Centre for Health
                    Protection, stated on 24 March that 408 warning letters were issued to people who violated the
                    quarantine order. People criticized the deterrent effect of quarantine.

                    Still, Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, has done a strict job on coronavirus relief,
                    banned public gatherings of more than four people since late March, while bars, fitness centres,
                    cinemas, pubs, and other leisure venues have been ordered to close for two weeks. Restaurants also
                    have to keep tables 1.5 meters apart.

                    Having gone through the SARS, the HK Government seems sensitive to the deadly outbreak of
                    coronavirus. Schools extended the Lunar New Year Holiday to 16 February when there were only five
                    cumulative local cases. Since then, EDB had changed decisions many times about the date of the
                    resumption of schools.

                <p class="lead">
                    Latterly, given that the epidemic situation has shown easing, EDB announced class resumption
                    arrangements in phases for all schools. However, to minimize the risk of infection and facilitate
                    schools' cleaning of their premises, all schools should only provide half-days.

                    In The 2020-21 Budget, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po's blueprint for the financial
                    year ahead was the bolstering of the city's overall health budget, the third-largest public
                    expenditure after education and social welfare, to a total of HK$97.7 billion, representing a 9.3

                    to improve staff retention, services, and research in late April, and given health authorities
                    coping with the coronavirus epidemic a HK$970 million cash injection.

                    that the government can do better next time a similar outbreak occurs in terms of virus testing, the
                    number of beds, and the arrangement of medical workers...

                    As the novel coronavirus has become a pandemic globally, responses and measures of different

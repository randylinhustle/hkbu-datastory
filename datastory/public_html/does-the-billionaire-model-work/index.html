						<h1>Does the Billionaire Model Work?</h1>
					</header>

					<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<p>Magazines and newspaper companies are mostly started by entrepreneurs and businessmen as side
						projects. Nowadays, tech billionaires still have tend to acquire prestigious media brands in the
						name of “giving back” and “aiming to make publications self-sufficient”. But how tech
						billionaires are reshaping the media landscape? Does the billionaire model work in terms of
						profitability, neutrality and competence?</p>
					<p>Despite the overall perception that newspapers and magazines are a sunset industry, billionaires,
						especially those associated with the tech industry, have entered the media landscape, presenting
						themselves as the saviors of various traditional media companies. Recent high profile examples
						include the purchase by Marc Benioff of Time, by Jeff Bezos of the Washington Post, by Jack Ma
						of the South China Morning Post, by Laurene Powell Jobs of The Atlantic, and by Patrick
						Soon-Shiong of the LA Times. </p>
					<p>According to their own statements, these billionaires relied on neither intuition nor analysis
						when making these acquisitions but rather considered their values to be aligned with those of
						the publications in question. </p>
					<div class="box alt">

								</blockquote>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>These media buyers also promised that they would refrain from intervening in editorial decisions,
						though concerns about their true intentions remain. They have made clear in interviews that they
						seek to develop thriving publication businesses through technological transformation, thereby
						bringing a digital perspective to print publications that will help journalism to survive as a
						business. </p>
					<p>It is uncertain whether such tech magnates are merely forging tools to shape public opinion or
						are actually seeking to benefit the public interest. The aim of the present article is to shed
						light on the kind of revolution that these new media owners are seeking to bring about in print
						media. The discussion addresses the potential for newsrooms and journalists to maintain their
						independence and the value of such media properties for the sharp-witted investor.</p>
					<p>The Washington Post serves as the primary example and the New York Times as the primary point of
						comparison, the latter being a historical rival of the Post for the up-market audience that was
						not, however, recently purchased by a billionaire. As the discussion makes clear, the Post is
						widely regarded as a successful case of the revitalization of a regional print outlet to serve
						as an international creator of news content in the digital arena. </p>

				</section>

				<section id="impartiality">
					<h2>I. Corporate ownership and media impartiality</h2>

					<p>Though there is no direct evidence that changes in newspaper ownership of the sort just described
						impede editorial independence, observers have expressed skepticism regarding the reliability of
						the information that newly purchased papers are disseminating. </p>
					<p>Leighley (2004) found that independently owned newspapers differ from corporately owned ones in
						terms of aspirations, with independent organizations being more committed to supporting
						ambitious journalistic practices and corporately held ones more focused on maximizing profits
						for their investors. One of the major concerns about the latter type of paper is self-censorship
						in the newsroom when it comes to covering news related to its owner. In particular, Bezos’s
						behavior, both in public and behind the scenes, is being scrutinized for its consistency with
						his claim that he does not influence the Post’s editorial processes. </p>

					<div class="box">
						<p>In order to explore these issues objectively, it is necessary to identify and quantify any
							changes in the coverage by media outlets following their purchase by various billionaires
							and determine whether these changes are associated with the change in ownership. For this
							purpose, the textual analysis of news stories about Amazon by the Post and New York Times
							presented here was conducted. Specifically, articles that were published as news with the
							subject “Amazon.com Inc” were collected from Proquest’s U.S. Major Daily database for the
							period from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2015. This timeframe was chosen because it
							brackets Bezos’s purchase of the Post in 2013. In total, 203 pieces of news from the Post
							and 281 from the New York Times were identified for analysis. </p>
					</div>

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/nyt_count.png" alt="" /></span>As the histogram shows,
						the average word count for articles in the Times (1,500) was significantly greater than that for
						articles in the Post (1,000). These statistics are of interest with respect to the quality of
						the news coverage and thus to editorial independence following the purchase of a media outlet.
						For while the length of stories does not necessarily correlate with their quality, it is
						nevertheless the case that shorter stories often lack the scope to provide meaningful
						intellectual stimulation.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/wp_count.png" alt="" /></span>Thus scholars have found
						that increased competition reduces the quality of news because journalists assume that their
						readers prefer emotional stories to thought-provoking ones (e.g., Zaller, 1999). Thus, while
						attracting customers is crucial for any business to survive, this imperative may be inconsistent
						with the journalistic objective of educating the public and may come to be replaced with the
						goal of entertaining the public.</p>

					<p>In order to analyze word frequency, all of the words that appeared over 200 times in the selected
						articles were used to create a word cloud. The articles in both the Post and the Times naturally
						made frequent use of the word “book” owing to the importance of the book trade for Amazon’s
						business. This was especially the case after the retailer’s launch of its Kindle Unlimited
						subscription in 2014 touched off a conflict with the publisher Hachette regarding the pricing of
						e-books. This conflict was reported in detail by both news outlets. In the Times, a great
						proportion of the articles mentioned Amazon’s peer companies in various industries, such as
						Google (as a technology firm) and Walmart (as a retailer). By contrast, these companies were
						rarely mentioned in the Post’s articles. </p>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/WP_Frequency.png"
										alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/NYT_Frequency.png"
										alt="" /></span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>There is an obvious difference between the two papers in their coverage of Amazon, with the Times
						showing greater interest in the company’s financial performance. Thus the word-level analysis
						revealed that the Times’s coverage more often used such terms as “tax,” “invest,” “market,”
						“revenue,” “sale,” “deal,” “share,” “store,” and “product.” The company’s performance as a
						technology provider was another focus of the coverage in the Times, as shown by the frequency of
						such terms as “Internet”, “video”, “technology,” and “web.” The word-level analysis of the
						articles in the Post indicates that that paper favored broader, non-specific categories when
						covering Amazon-related issues. Further, the words “Bezos”, “Washington,” and “Post” appeared
						more frequently than in the Post than in the Times, though in large part because the articles
						about Amazon in the former paper included the disclaimer that “Amazon.com chief executive
						Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.” </p>

					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/WP_sent.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/NYT_sent.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>When it comes to sentiment analysis, as the chart shows, a similar pattern was found for both
						newspapers, with “anticipation”—a relatively moderate sentiment compared with the others
						documented—receiving the highest score. The package and method were designed to measure
						sentiment on Twitter. Therefore, the sentiments included were “anger,” “anticipation,”
						“disgust,” “fear,” “joy,” “sadness,” and “surprise.” These findings are consistent with the
						notion that the shift in the Post’s ownership has had little influence on the portrayal of its
						famous new owner. </p>

					<p>However, this analysis of word counts and frequencies and of sentiments may not provide an
						accurate picture of the news reporting process. Further, the four-year time frame may have been
						insufficient to detect the fundamental, long-term evolution of news coverage, while the
						differing reporting habits of the two news outlets may be less significant than a first glance
						would suggest. The Post’s preference for short articles, even if intended to pander to the
						tastes of its readers, therefore, may not significantly compromise the objectivity and
						professionism of its reporting but may rather be seen as an aspect of the paper’s strategic
						transformation. </p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/excel.png" alt="" /></span>

					<div class="box">
						<p>A methodological problem must also be acknowledged regarding the Post’s tendency, apparent in
							the data collected for this study, to modify and repost the same piece of news multiple
							times. Regardless of the extent of the modification, subsequent iterations of a single story
							were identified as distinct stories by Proquest’s algorithm. The resulting duplication may
							compromise the accuracy of the count-based method used here. </p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="revolution">
					<h2>II. The impact of increased funding on the newsroom revolution</h2>
					<p>Because he bought the Post with $250 million of his own money, rather than Amazon’s, Bezos was
						not compelled to convince his company’s bottom line-focused shareholders that the 140-year-old
						newspaper would be profitable after its reinvention as a "media and technology company."
						Nevertheless, the Post does enjoy some financial benefits as a result of the purchase. Thus, for
						instance, compared with its main competitor, the New York Times, the paper receives some four
						times as much advertising from Amazon.com—as indeed would be expected. </p>

					<p>According to the website analytics firm SimilarWeb, the top five advertisers for the websites of
						both the Times and the Post are Youtube, Nordstrom, Macy’s, Amazon, and Wayfair. As an
						advertiser, Amazon sent a total of 2.0 percent of its traffic to these two newspaper websites,
						of which 80.2 percent went to the Post and 19.8 percent to the Times (this being the four-fold
						difference just mentioned). </p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Another indication of the resources available to the Post is that it runs few advertisements on
						mobile devices and almost none on its homepage. Rather, advertisements appear only in
						association with the inside articles, where they promote the Post’s own products, such as
						magazines or newsletters. The Times, by contrast, runs external advertainment on its homepage as
						well as its inside pages, and even those who sign in as subscribers are exposed to external
						advertisements. The distracting content makes for a poor user experience, and the Times’s mobile
						app has been less effective as a tool for branding than the Post’s. </p>
					<p>In order to encourage the purchase of real-time automated ads for display on its website, the
						Post unveiled Zeus Prime in 2019, new software designed to offer advertisers an alternative to
						purchasing ads on Google and Facebook. This effort represents a response to the fact that, in
						recent years, the latter two platforms have dominated digital marketing and been rewarded with a
						large share of the revenue. For the Post, regaining a significant share of advertising revenue
						represents a crucial step toward the financial independence of online news media. After its
						purchase by Bezos, then, the Post has recognized the problem with its business model and, thanks
						to his resources, has had the ability to compete with the digital marketing duopoly of Google
						and Facebook and proceed with its digital transformation into “the earth’s most customer-centric
						company.” </p>
					<p>Now, seven years after Bezos’s acquisition of the Post, it is possible to assess the platform
						technical changes as well as whether the paper has, in fact, been moving away from expensive
						long-term investigative reporting that challenges readers intellectually. One way to explore
						these issues is from the perspective of personnel changes in the company and the success of its
						efforts to adapt traditional journalism to the newly emerging online platforms.</p>

					<h2>A. Going digital</h2>
					<p>The Times Company’s chief executive, Mark Thompson, called attention in a 2014 report to the
						urgency of the situation for the industry as the field for alternative digital media becomes
						increasingly crowded, well-funded, and innovative. Based on the analysis by SimilarWeb, the
						Post, compared with the Times, tends to receive only the half monthly visits from Desktop,
						whereas the gap between these visits and those from mobile devices has narrowed. Thus, in
						December 2019, the Post recorded over 70 million visits from desktops and 74 million from mobile
						devices, while the Times has a recorded 135 million visits from desktops and 108 million from
						mobile devices. The Times, then, received more visitors from either platform; on the other hand,
						the Post’s website performed better in terms of visit duration, pages viewed per visit, and
						bounce rate. </p>

					<p>Accordingly, the Post’s most widely discussed effort to improve reader experience has been its
						Accelerated Mobile Pages Project, which shortens the loading time for the site from three
						seconds to one second on mobile devices. The result has been a five-fold increase in engagement
						according to Joey Marburger, the Post’s director of product. The thinking seems to be that every
						millisecond counts when it comes to mobile load times for audiences easily distracted by other
						news apps on their phones.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="content">
					<h2>B. Devotion to content</h2>
					<p>The Times currently operates English-, Spanish-, and Chinese-language news websites. The Post, by
						contrast, makes available only an English-language site, though it did introduce a new
						Spanish-language podcast and opinion section in December 2019 in an indication of its
						international plans. The paper also opened international bureaus in Rome and Hong Kong in 2018
						to broaden worldwide news coverage, at which time it employed 27 reporters in 19 foreign
						locations.</p>
					<p>In order to realize Bezos’s ambitions, what was once a local news outlet has invested heavily in
						the creation of technology and content. This move defies the overall trend in U.S. newsrooms,
						where the number of employees overall dropped by 47% from 2008 to 2018. Bezos’s Post had added
						100 journalists, for a total of 700, by 2017 and in June 2019 announced plans to hire 10 more
						investigative journalist positions to supplement further its Investment Unit. The Times has also
						been investing in its newsroom, which as of 2019 employed more journalists than that of any
						other U.S. paper, a total of 1,600.</p>
					<p>The Post and Times support similar numbers of the newsletters (69 and 67, respectively) and
						podcasts (19 and 6) referred to earlier. Given the much larger staff at the Times, these numbers
						hint at the workload borne by the Post’s newsroom. Though these services are provided for free,
						the Post again has plans for making them the basis of a profitable business; thus, it launched a
						subscribers’ exclusive audio series in 2018.</p>
					<p>Another for-pay service is “Voraciously,” a food platform launched by the Post in 2018 to compete
						with the Times’s popular cooking section and the NYT Cooking app. This app, which debuted in
						2014 and costs $5 monthly, has found a large audience, having amassed some 120,000 subscribers
						by 2018.</p>
					<p>Other product pushes, such as Fact Check, Lifestyle, and Launcher—the latter being a new section
						devoted to video games and e-sports—are giving the Post an increasingly broad platform for
						reaching international and multi-layered, targeted subscribers.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="technologist">
					<h2>C. Embracing technologists</h2>
					<p>According to research conducted by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) into the state
						of technology in global newsrooms, while technologists remain relatively rare in newsrooms,
						there was a slight increase in the numbers of managers and journalists holding degrees in
						tech-related fields from 2017 to 2019. For the leaders of the news digitalization movement,
						there has been an obvious surge in the assignment of employees to the new roles that are being
						created as the Internet evolves.</p>
					<p>LinkedIn data indicate that the Times currently has a workforce of around 6,225, including both
						full- and part-time employees and those at such subsidiaries as Wirecutter and NYT Open. The
						Post has a workforce of 2,883, again according to LinkedIn.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/whattheydo.jpg" alt="" /></span>For both papers, the
						top job categories for employees in terms of numbers are media and
						communication and art and design. The next most heavily staffed positions at the Post are in
						operations, engineering, information technology, and business development and at the Times in
						business development, marketing, engineering, and operations. Thus, while both papers value
						employees with skills in journalism, design, technology, and marketing, marketing and business
						development are more valued by the Times and technology-related skills by the Post.</p>
					<p>In terms of educational background, both papers’ employees hold degrees in a range of fields
						including not only journalism and political science but also English literature, history, and,
						in keeping with the focus of the present discussion, computer science. Thus workers with
						technology and engineering skills are now sought for as well as the reporters and editors who
						have been the backbone of the industry. The latter have remained dominant even in today’s
						constantly changing environment because they generate the content. The Post’s growing interest
						in combining roles and hiring individuals with diverse backgrounds seems intended to lay the
						foundation for further digital innovation.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/skill.jpg" alt="" /></span>The LinkedIn data further
						show that the main skills sought by the two publishers are in
						journalism and editing but also social media, which have come to play a vital role in the modern
						news business. Thus social media now serve to promote journalism, to provide rapid and accurate
						coverage of breaking news, to harvest information, and to engage with consumers. </p>
					<p>The changes coming to newsrooms are difficult to predict, but the Post’s CEO and publisher Fred
						Ryan gave a hint in an interview when he observed that "In 2011, there were four engineers in
						the Washington Post newsroom. Today there are over 300."</p>
					<p>There is no set number of technology personnel sufficient for a traditional newspaper to complete
						a successful digital transformation. It does seem that most papers going forward will be hiring
						more employees with engineering backgrounds in order to transfer more of their business to
						digital media.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="cooperation">
					<h2>D. Cooperation and competition among online digital platforms</h2>
					<p>Consumers of media are gradually becoming used to paying for online services separately, a
						situation that has led to a subscription battle between the Times and the Post. At the same
						time, digital news services must also compete with various other forms of online media,
						including video streaming platforms such as Netflix and music streaming services such as
						Spotify.</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/socialmedia.png" alt="" /></span>
					<div class="box">
						<p>According to a survey conducted by the Reuters Institute, most media consumers, if forced to
							choose only one online media subscription for the next year, would opt for a video streaming
							service. Only 7 percent of those under the age of 45 would opt instead for online news,
							though the number rises to 15 percent for those over 45. The clear implication is that news
							outlets are finding it difficult to attract younger audiences owing to competition from the
							wide range of online platforms now available. If they are to survive, then, news outlets
							cannot simply focus on profits from the older generation but must reach out to the younger
							generation on whatever platforms they are using. </p>
					</div>
					<p>The Post in particular has made an effort in this regard, having already accumulated 359,100
						followers on TikTok, which is widely recognized as for the most part a Gen Z-propelled social
						media platform. The Times, by contrast, has yet to create a TikTok account. So also with Twitch,
						a live streaming platform targeting mainly video gamers that Bezos purchased in 2016. The Post
						launched a channel on the platform in 2018 that has since attracted 44,500 followers. Once more,
						the Times has not shown interest in this aspect of the media business. The Post’s effort in this
						regard has not been a resounding success, with views and reaches relatively low at only around
						100 views per video. It seems that the Post is trying to reach niche markets and audiences that
						are not particularly attentive to news and public debates through a marketing strategy that
						involves ubiquity online and a subtle approach to prospective customers.</p>

					<p>On the more traditional social media platforms, the Times has generally accumulated a greater
						audience base than the Post. However, in terms of interactions with its audiences and
						productivity, the Post usually ranks higher than the Times. </p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/traditionalmedia.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Taking YouTube as an example, the Times has a distinct advantage in the number of followers and
						the Post in the number of interactions. More of the Post’s videos have been uploaded than those
						posted by the Times. The latter paper, though, is ahead in terms of the sum of likes, dislikes,
						and comments. In any case, these figures suggest that the Post’s audience is becoming
						increasingly loyal and engaged and therefore more valuable for the paper’s profits than their
						numbers would suggest.</p>
					<p>Not only has the Post garnered considerable praise for its successful digital transformation, but
						it has long been marketing this transformation in its WashPost PR Blog. The Times’s equivalent,
						New York Times Communications, by contrast, serves to handle press inquiries and to issue
						company disclosures to investors. The WashPost PR Blog has initialized multiple collaborative
						projects with elite partners across various platforms and has been launching new products
						frequently to test possible new markets.</p>
					<p>The table below presents an overview of third-party collaborations since the launch of The
						WashPost PR Blog in 2017. Not surprisingly, most of these partners have been from tech-related
						firms, and some are industry competitors. One such competitor is Apple News, a news aggregator
						with a readership that reached 85 million in 2019. Renowned papers such as the Wall Street
						Journal and LA Times have also joined the program and contributed content. The Post and Times
						for their part have been reluctant to partner with Apple News, both because Apple reaps half of
						the subscription revenue and because the publishers have little control over the display of
						their content or interactions with their readers. However, the Post has not completely shut the
						door on such cooperation, clearly not wanting to miss the chance to reach new markets. Thus, in
						2017 it tested showcasing video for the newly developed Apple News widget and in 2018 created a
						new elections experience for readers on the platform.</p>

					<p>The mindset of the Post’s product managers is aligned with that of technology companies’ product
						managers, in that both groups of managers bring new ideas to the market in the hopes of keeping
						their customers satisfied. Irrespective of the success of its efforts in this regard—and many of
						these efforts have, in fact, benefitted the company—the Post will remain in the spotlight owing
						to its status as a leading technological innovator.</p>

					<h2>III. The outcome for Jeff Bezos</h2>
					<p>In assessing whether his purchase of the Washington Post for $250 million was a wise one for Jeff
						Bezos himself, it is necessary to consider the paper’s business plan.</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/subscription.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>To begin with, the Post sets a relatively low price point, with a monthly digital subscription
						costing only two-thirds that of a New York Times subscription. As a consequence, the Post has a
						somewhat broader appeal to price-conscious media consumers. </p>
					<p>Nevertheless, as the chart shows, the New York Times had 2.7 million digital subscribers in 2019
						and the Washington Post 1.7 million. Of course, digital subscriptions are not the only source of
						subscription revenue, so legacy media like the Times and Post have worked to maintain their
						loyal readers. Constant innovation and the provision of personalized products seem to be
						especially promising strategies for these papers in the evolving media marketplace. The Post has
						shown signs of success in these terms; thus it was named the world’s most innovative media
						company in 2018 by Fast Company magazine “for bringing Amazonian ambition to news,” having
						previously been awarded the title in 2015 and 2017 as well. The Times has also been successful
						in this regard, having received the award for innovation in media from Fast Company in 2012 and
						2019 along with that of the world’s most innovative virtual reality media provider in 2016.</p>

					<p>The Post’s most valuable asset, however, is not its subscriber base but its in-house software
						firm Arc Publishing, a platform for helping businesses to manage digital content. Its major peer
						company in this venture is WordPress, but Arc has the advantage of being able to rely on
						Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud computing operation. According to Bloomberg, Arc is expected to generate
						$100 million in annual revenue within three years. Since the firm’s licensing business debuted
						in 2014, its customer base has expanded to the operation of more than 600 websites for media
						companies worldwide. Among the Post’s intangible assets may also be included a shift in the
						reputations of various news outlets and the consolidation of Bezos’s public image as a leader in
						digitalization with a genuine interest in revitalizing important spaces for public discourse.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="conclusion">
					<p>In sum, the benefits that Jeff Bezos is likely to accrue in the long term from his acquisition of
						the Post appear to justify his $250 million investment in the paper in 2013. From many
						perspectives, the marriage between the tech titan and the prestigious publication seems perfect.
						Thus Bezos, according to the available evidence, has been distancing himself from his paper’s
						editorial decisions while the technological transformation of the company that he is overseeing
						is revitalizing it and reshaping news consumption habits generally.</p>
					<p>No marriage is perfect, though, and the Post’s reshaping as a tech company has heightened its
						readers’ suspicion of its owner when they consume the paper’s news products. Perhaps the
						constant bombardment with images of Jeff Bezos in a variety of contexts also makes it difficult
						to think of the Post as a neutral news organization. A particularly vexatious issue for the
						paper in this respect is the longstanding hostility between Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos, with
						the president branding the paper the “Amazon Washington Post” and insisting that its reporting
						reflects its owner’s personal interests.</p>
					<p>If Bezos’s investment in the Washington Post does in fact prove to have been a savvy one, a
						wholesale invasion of the publishing industry by tech-oriented investors may be inevitable.
						Moreover, tech-driven publications are almost by definition positioned to compete in the online
						media market. It remains to be seen how publications like the Post will navigate their
						relationships with their famous owners and whether the standard disclosure statements will be
						sufficient to guarantee readers’ confidence in the journalism that they consume. At least in
						countries in which the media are not dominated by the government, the markets will have the
						final say in the success or failure of the billionaire model for news media.</p>

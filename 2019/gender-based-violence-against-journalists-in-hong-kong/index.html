				<p class="lead">Since June 2019, protests have been staged every weekend in Hong Kong against a
					controversial extradition bill. Journalists on the front lines covering the protests, including
					conflicts between protesters and police, have been intentionally assaulted by the latter. The city’s
					journalists have staged several protests of their own against police to defend their rights, but the
					hostility from law enforcement has not abated, including frequent gender-based harassment targeting
					mainly women.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Thus, for example, Amy Ip, a freelance female journalist, recounted in <a
						href="https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/%E8%AD%A6%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85%E6%9C%83%E4%B8%8A%E7%85%A7%E9%9B%BB%E7%AD%92%E6%8A%97%E8%AD%B0%E8%A2%AB%E9%80%90-%E5%A5%B3%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85-%E8%A2%AB-pprb-%E6%8B%8D%E6%94%9D%E8%AD%89%E4%BB%B6%E5%BE%8C%E7%9B%B8%E7%89%87%E5%8D%B3%E6%96%BC%E7%B6%B2%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%81%E5%82%B3/"><span><u>an
								interview with
								Stand News</u></span></a> that her name and photo had been circulated widely online by
					pro-establishment groups
					after she read a statement and pointed a flashlight at an official in a show of outrage at the
					treatment of journalists during a daily police press conference. When she went on to criticize
					specifically the use of force against media workers, the press conference was aborted. The ensuing
					doxxing by pro-Beijing groups blamed her for “drawing attention” (搏出位) and included references to
					her with the term jizhe (妓者), which forms a crude pun based on the similar pronunciation of the
					Chinese words for “prostitute” and “journalist.”</p>

				<p class="lead">Again, and not surprisingly, gender-based verbal attacks are nearly always directed at
					women, including, in addition to jizhe, “smelly chicken” (臭雞, another term for prostitutes) and
					“gossipy old lady” (八婆).</p>

				<p class="lead">During recent protests across the city, the attacks on journalists have included
					counselingcal as well as verbal abuse; the discussion here will deal with both forms of abuse in
					turn.</p>

				<h1>Jessica Lo: Gender-based verbal abuse is hurtful</h1>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Jessica Lo, currently a fourth-year journalism and mass communication student at Hong Kong Shue
						Yan University, is among those who have commented on the personal attacks that female
						journalists
						endure based on their gender and appearance. She had an internship in NowTV from June to August
						and
						has been working part-time for the station covering local news for the past few months. </p>
					<p>
						In this
						capacity, she was assigned to cover the rally organized by Politihk Social Strategic, a
						pro-Beijing
						organization, outside the media outlet Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) on August 24. The
						protesters were accusing RTHK of biased in its reporting on the unrest. When she received the
						assignment, Lo never expected that she would be attacked by the protesters.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<div class="youtube-player" data-id="FBD5lwrbr54"></div><br>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Can you briefly describe the situation of that day?</b></p>

				<p class="lead">JL: I arrived outside RTHK alone around 2 pm. My cameraman was still on the way from the
					office, so I decided to use my mobile phone to take some footage. Before taking the videos, I donned
					a yellow vest with a press card to avoid any misunderstanding [about my role] by the crowds.
					However, some participants surrounded me and stopped me from filming.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Did you encounter any problems during the protest, such as physical or verbal
						abuse?
					</b></p>

				<p class="lead">JL: I was kicked two times, by a male protestor and a female protester, while I was
					walking. When I started to film with my mobile phone, someone struck the phone and I was almost
					knocked to the ground. I also endured verbal attacks. Some protesters pointed at me, almost touching
					my eyes with their fingers. Most of the protesters there were male, and the majority of the
					journalists there were female, and almost all of the female journalists were blamed and insulted.
					They used gender-based language to attack us.</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Did you think of this as sexual harassment?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">JL: Yes, I considered it sexual harassment. They used sexual words to attack us.
					Although I haven’t experienced any physical sexual harassment, I know that other female journalists
					have.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: What did you feel when you heard those [i.e., abusive] words?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">JL: I have to admit that I felt very scared, but I knew it was useless to argue with
					them. I was frustrated because of the man’s vehement actions at that moment. It was difficult for me
					to hear what he said at the time. When I went back home and watched the playback, then I clearly
					understood what he had said... I must admit that I have sore feelings after watching those clips.
					It is hard to stay calm in the face of all the insults.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: How did you cope with your sore feelings? Did you cry?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">JL: No, I did not cry. But I felt upset. Interviewing people is my job, and I just want
					to report the truth. Why do they treat me like that? Maybe I’m still young and fresh. I know some
					journalists may have gotten used to it, but I really cannot stand still and remain silent.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Do you think that male journalists face less sexual abuse than female
						journalists?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">JL: Yes. I think male journalists face fewer sexual insults because those words have no
					impact on them. They are usually attacked because of their profession. I believe that female
					journalists face more personal attacks because of gender and appearance.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Did you report [the harassment] to NowTV immediately? What did they do to help
						you?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">JL: Yes, NowTV sent another crew to help us later. At same time, NowTV reported what
					happened to the police. But you know, it doesn’t help much at all. I don’t think anyone will be
					arrested in this case.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Do you think that society discriminates against female journalists?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">JL: Kind of. The image of male journalists is that they are smart and good at numbers,
					so they are usually responsible for financial news. However, there are also advantages to be a
					female journalist. For example, we are always regarded as caring and good at communicating with
					people. Investigative reporting and feature stories are usually assigned to us.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: What can your agency do to help? Is there pre- or post-protest assistance for
						journalists?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead"> JL: I think the media agency can provide psychological support for full-time
					journalists in
					dealing with the stress. They provide training to all journalists in preparation [for covering
					the protests], but it is mainly focused on practical skills.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Regarding the source of the sources of the harassment that Lo and other journalists have
					suffered, in a recent survey of members of the press by Hong Kong Baptist University, 38% of
					respondents said that they had been targeted with verbal abuse by the police, 23% by citizen
					onlookers, 20% by protesters, 7% by other reporters, and 1% by gangs in the North Point area. Some
					51% felt that the abuse was clearly gender-based and 55% said that it had affected their mood at
					work.

				<blockquote>
					<p>Vimvam Tong spent two-and-a-half months (June to mid-August 2019) on the front lines of most of
						the protests that took place in this period as a journalism intern for Reuters. Tong reported

				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q：Would you recount your most memorable interview experience?
					</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">VT: That would be June 30, a Sunday. I covered both a pro-democratic protest near the
					Legislative Council and a pro-police rally in Tamar Park, which is not far away. I was fortunate to
					have the chance to interview individuals on both sides, especially at the pro-police rally.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Most of the police-supporters were middle-aged and very suspicious of journalists. They
					accused us of biased news reporting and challenged our professionalism, particularly that of female
					journalists. They blamed us for being mouthpieces for the mob and ignoring the violent behavior of
					those demonstrating against the police, but of course this is not true.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: In addition to the questioning of the professionalism of journalists, was there
						any gender-based discrimination against them?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">VT: I didn't encounter any insults targeting women at that event [i.e., on June 30]
					explicitly. However, in a later assignment covering the Reclaim Sheung Shui demonstration, we were
					subjected to some unwarranted scolding by the police. Still, remember, some other female journalists
					have indicated that the police have had physical contact with them, and they had to warn the police
					on the spot that this behavior constituted sexual harassment.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">In fact, female reporters are perceived to be more easily controlled. The police more
					frequently ordered female reporters to stop reporting from the front lines, while my male colleagues
					received less attention from them. This may have been because the majority believed that “girls on
					the frontline need to be taken care of by men.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: You said that your male colleagues received less attention from the police; can
						you elaborate on this?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">VT: Well, as an intern, I didn’t really have much experience reporting on the protests.
					When I was covering a demonstration near the Hong Kong Liaison Office, the police raised a warning
					flag to indicate that they were about to release tear gas. I realized that I had forgotten to bring
					my gear, including a gas mask, so I approached the police for help. However, they told me to leave,
					to run to a safe place. I felt that their attitude was like they were trying to tell me “this is no
					place for a little girl.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">It’s hard to say whether the reporters are assigned based on gender. We have one
					camerawoman, she has been on the frontline for a long time. For me, it seemed hard to be assigned to
					the very front line because of my limited experience. Additionally, I didn't have training in such
					hostile environment formerly, so that's why my editor concerned about the safety of me.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: How did this nearly three-month experience affect your mood?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">VT: No doubt I was traumatized. For example, every time I see hundreds of police dressed
					in riot gear knocking their shields loudly and shouting, “go away,” I feel like they are going to
					push me from my back. But, being a journalist, I should stay on the front lines. The verbal attack
					also had a psychological impact on me.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Can these traumas be healed? Do you think that your news agency should help?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">VT: Over the past few months, the political atmosphere in Hong Kong has been very
					repressive, and this has impacted our working environment. There’s distrust between the two sides
					[i.e., police and demonstrators]. If any even slightly biased content is reported by a journalist,
					the side that is disadvantaged will be all abuzz.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">I think the best way to solve the psychological problem is by yourself. The news agency
					I work for also provided counseling services if we wanted them. At the same time, my editor-in-chief
					also talked to me frequently and showed her concern about my physical and mental health. If you feel
					uncomfortable continuing the assignments [she told me], you are free to go.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">In the aforementioned survey, 41% of respondents said that editors assigned journalists
					to cover the protests based on gender; 14% perceived that gender discrimination was an issue in the
					newsroom; and 24% felt that female journalists endured gender discrimination in Hong Kong society
					generally.

				<h1>Mental wellness support for journalists
				</h1>

				<blockquote>
					<p>“Journalists on the front lines understand that they may be hurt at any time, which is another
						kind of pressure that we are exposed to.”—Bethanie Ho</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p class="lead">“We became more sensitive after covering the protests... We are very alert when we
					smell tear gas or hear a sudden loud voice, even when we’re not on the job,” said Bethanie Ho, a
					journalist working in Ming Pao who graduated from Hong Kong Baptist University three years ago.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Covering the protests has subjected journalists to various forms of mental pressure and
					evoked in them mixed emotions. Ho was on the front lines on June 12 at the beginning of particularly
					intense clashes between protesters and police. “After that day, we needed to go back to finish our
					news story with a calm and professional attitude amid the chaotic situation. It was difficult to
					keep my emotions in check that night after I finished my story.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“Journalists on the front lines understand that they may be hurt at any time, which is
					another kind of pressure that we are exposed to,” Ho added. “For myself, my greatest anxiety was on
					June 17. I witnessed a change in the mood of the movement and felt powerless.” It was on that day
					that a man committed politically-motivated suicide by jumping from Pacific Place in the Admiralty
					district.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">In the survey, as the figure shows, 89% of the respondents agreed that news agencies
					should provide journalists with emotional and psychological counseling.
				</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4662286">
					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">Asked whether journalists need such counseling, Ho and a colleague, Alpha Chan, answered
					in the affirmative.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“Journalists’ mental health is something that should receive considerable attention,
					especially since journalists constantly witness things that normal people don’t,” said the latter,
					also a journalist working in Ming Pao. She suggested that journalists may feel anxious after being
					assigned to accidents, especially severe ones like the 2016 Amoycan Industrial Centre fire, the
					crash of a double-decker bus in Tai Po in 2018, or the ongoing protests.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">These two journalists’ news agency had arranged for discussion and sharing of
					experiences, inviting psychology professors to support the journalists. However, not every
					journalist has the resources to afford these kinds of services, and Lo suggested that all news
					agencies should provide mental assistance to their journalists, especially the full-time and
					front-line staff.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Anna Kam, a year fourth-year international journalism student at Hong Kong Baptist
					University, however, said that “If mental assistance is provided, I would leave it to other
					journalists, as I didn’t suffer from serious trauma after reporting on the protests. I do believe
					that all front-line journalists need [access to] counseling services.” She had worked as a freelance
					journalist for four international media agencies and said that none had provided mental wellness
					support or counseling.

				<h1>Can the law protect female journalists?
				</h1>

				<p class="lead">Turning again to the survey, among respondents who reported physical attacks, 45%
					attributed the abuse to the police, 18% to demonstrators, 12% to citizen onlookers, and 8% to fellow
					journalists. Further, 16% described the abuse as gender-based, and 57% said that it had impacted
					their emotions at work.
				</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/681397">
					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">When reporters encounter physical abuse on the job, including sexual harassment, some
					existing laws may help to protect them. Thus, for instance, Hong Kong’s Sex Discrimination Ordinance
					(SDO) protects individuals from sexual harassment and victimization in prescribed areas, including
					employment.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“Journalists and practitioners in the media industry have the same protection from
					sexual harassment and sex discrimination under the SDO [as other workers],” asserted Dorothy Sam,
					the Corporate Communications Manager of Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) in a written reply.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">The EOC handles complaints from individuals who feel that they have been discriminated
					against in any of the prescribed areas. According to Sam, the commission endeavors to resolve cases
					that have been deemed actionable after examination of all relevant information through
					reconciliation so that the disputing parties reach a settlement. Its assistance includes legal
					advice.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Sam pointed out that, because the figures for complaints made to the EOC are not
					categorized by industry, no specific figures for complaints from journalists are currently
					available. In any case, though, there is some doubt regarding whether journalists covering the
					protests are in fact free to send their complaints to the commission. Thus one journalist, who spoke
					on the condition that her identity would not be revealed, pointed out that the EOC seldom followed
					up on any of its investigations or addressed gender issues proactively. It is therefore unclear
					whether the gender discrimination that female journalists are facing predates the recent wave of
					protests or whether it is in fact common throughout the media industry.

					</svg>The social status of Hong Kong journalists has been improving. (Credit: Vimvam Tong)
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“From gendered disparities in wage income to the levels of participation in the labor
					market,
					job opportunities remain unequal for men and women in today’s Hong Kong,” said Susanne Yuk-ping
					Choi, a professor of social studies and expert on gender issues at Hong Kong Chinese University.
					“Sexual harassment has emerged across industries, mostly involving gender bias and power
					imbalances.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Choi added that the harassment faced by journalists may be particularly complicated
					because it occurs not only within news agencies but also during interviews. It is quite
					challenging for journalists to complain about or report such abuse at the scene because of the
					limited information that they have about such abusers.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Whatever their merits Hong Kong’s laws on sexual harassment—the aforementioned SDO
					enforced by the EOC—have significant shortcomings. Thus Choi observed, “If sexual harassment,
					such as verbal harassment, is related to civil conflict, the only way to complain is to go to
					the EOC. The problem is that attacks [on reporters] by interviewees are difficult to attribute
					unless the exact perpetrator is caught on the spot. Besides, the current ordinance does not
					necessarily cover sexual harassment by interviewees. The laws do regulate the employer in that,
					if an employee is sexually harassed, the employer shares legal responsibility.”

				<p class="lead">Choi felt that the social status of Hong Kong journalists has been improving
					significantly during the political disturbances but that news agencies should provide more
					specialized training to their employees for dealing with harassment in such situations. At the
					same time, she affirmed, intra-company psychological counseling is also very significant. “Many
					news agencies actually fail to establish special mechanisms to handle such questions because the
					ordinance does not stipulate that they must do so,” she observed.

				<h1>Gender is an issue not only for reporters covering protests but across the media industry
				</h1>

				<blockquote>
					<p>“You are not allowed to do that assignment—not because of your experience but because you were
						born
						female.”—Experienced journalists</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p class="lead">A female journalist, who does not want to disclose her name, tells about how female
					journalists work in her former workplace, a TV news station.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Another female journalist who did not wish to disclose her name described the situation
					for herself and her female colleagues at a TV news station where she used to work. “Female
					journalists are not allowed to cover ‘dangerous’ situations. For example, during a typhoon, they are
					not allowed to go out because they look weak. This policy was implemented after the TV station
					received complaints that it was mistreating female journalists by sending them out into extreme
					weather. This urge to protect women may be understandable, but a journalist’s job is to reveal the
					truth and disclose secrets to the public, and female journalists just like male ones desire
					opportunities to report on various kinds of news, even from potentially dangerous scenes. Thus, the
					desire to protect women in this way reflects not merely concern for their safety but also a form of
					discrimination against them.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“Gender dominance happens in the newsroom and outside the newsroom,” the anonymous
					reporter went on. “Not to mention the fact that the staff on the management level is usually male
					and that gender issues also arise while journalists are engaged in reporting. In fact, most of the
					journalists in Hong Kong are female, and their assignments usually pair them with a male cameraman.
					The two cooperate in deciding how to report on the news. Now think about it; will an experienced
					male cameraman listen to the ideas of a young and less experienced female journalist? This
					combination [of media professionals] is common in reality. Women dominate the industry in terms of
					numbers, but the power that they exercise is not commensurate.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Julie Posetti, an Australian journalist who studies cyber-harassment, has investigated
					the attacks on female journalists in Hong Kong. Her research confirms that the abuse of these women
					often targets their physical appearance and gender , including such insults as “slut,” “bitch,” and
					“prostitute.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">According to research conducted by DEMOS in Britain in 2014, female journalists and TV
					news presenters receive roughly three times as much abuse as their male counterparts.

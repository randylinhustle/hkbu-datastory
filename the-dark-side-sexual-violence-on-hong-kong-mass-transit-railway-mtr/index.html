				<p class="lead">“If a woman says she likes sex, does that mean she likes being raped?” asked Winnie Wong
					Wai Yin, a fourth-year film student at Hong Kong Baptist University.</p>

				<p class="lead">Wong said that she had experienced sexual harassment on multiple occasions, recalling
					one incident when she was in secondary school.</p>

				<p class="lead"><a><img width="150" height="150" class="pull-right" alt="sample-image"
							src="images/sample-image.jpg"></a>“I was on my way home from school and took the MTR from
					Kowloon Tong station to Tai Wai. I was listening to music, so I wasn’t paying much attention to my
					surroundings. Suddenly, I noticed something rubbing against my dress and at first thought it might
					be some lady’s carry-on. Still, it felt odd, as the ‘touch’ was rhythmic. When I turned around, I
					saw a man behind me,” Wong recollected. “I was so startled that I just stared at him instead of
					reacting, and then I immediately left the train.</p>

				<p class="lead">“I am furious and regret that I didn’t report the incident at the time. There may be
					other girls who have suffered the same sexual harassment that I have but also did not report it,”
					observed Wong.</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/4011509"

					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">An analysis of news reports about sexual violence at MTR stations by various Hong Kong
					media outlets over the past six years showed that sexual violence occurred frequently at the
					Admiralty and Prince Edward Stations, at each of which nearly 30 incidents were reported, as well as
					the Wan Chai and Kowloon Tong Stations.
				</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/4015368">
					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">Under a government policy emphasizing rail transport, the MTR is the most common way to
					get around Hong Kong, with over 5 million trips occurring on an average weekday. Thus, according to
					one study, the Island, Tsuen Wan, and East Rail Lines each had over 1 million riders on weekdays in
					the period from September 1 to 27, 2014.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"> The MTR is not the only place where Wong has been sexually harassed, with other
					incidents occurring
					on the bus and a bike path.</p>

				<p class="lead">In such instances, those who experience sexual harassment are often blamed for it. Wong
					recalled that, when she sought help from a friend after one incident, “She told me not to wear a
					short skirt to minimize the chances of sexual harassment.” She was disappointed with this response.
					“Just because I’m keen to wear short skirts and drink with my friends until midnight, does that mean
					it’s justified for a man to sexually assault me? It’s ridiculous.” </p>

				</p>

				<p class="lead">Wong felt that victims were becoming increasingly willing to open up about their
					experiences with sexual harassment following the social movement last year and that there were some
					downsides to the visibility of the issue. “I think there are more people who encounter sexual
					harassment,” she explained. “Because the police aren’t trusted by certain individuals—like me—people
					who are thinking about it [committing sexual assault] may think we won’t report it even if we’ve
					been harmed, so they may not suffer any consequences.” She was, therefore, worried that the problem
					would grow worse.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Wong suggested that the government should increase the penalties for crimes committed in
					MTR stations and that non-profit organizations could post flyers and signs encouraging children to
					speak up and ask for help immediately if they suffer abuse. In her experience, Wong said, she had
					felt that there was nothing she could do about it after being harassed.</p>

				<h1>Oskar Wan: More active bystanders are urgently needed</h1>

				<blockquote>
					<p>"Sexual Innuendo + Reluctance = Sexual Violence"</p>

				</blockquote>

				<p class="randall">The Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women, or ACSVAW, is a
					non-governmental organization based in Hong Kong that, for 23 years, has been dedicated to raising
					awareness of sexual violence against women and promoting a gender-equitable environment.
				</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/668890">
					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">A recent online survey conducted by the Gender-friendly Environment Group documented 419
					verified incidents in which individuals had experienced or witnessed sexual violence in the MTR over
					the past three years. Among the 72 percent of respondents who had experienced sexual
					violence—including being unnecessarily touched or rubbed—over 90 percent said that the incidents had
					occurred on the train.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“There is often the demand in society that these victims immediately speak up and call
					for help from those around them, but the fact is that they may have been unable to resist because of
					the immense fear they felt,” said Oskar Wan, the group’s community organiser. “The key, therefore,
					is for bystanders to be able to step in and intervene, which is the quickest and most effective way
					to help.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Wan observed that the MTR Corporation had not attempted to promote or educate the public
					about the “active bystander” initiative, leaving a gap that urgently needed to be filled. “Such
					advocacy can lead to the creation of a positive atmosphere of mutual help and assistance in a kind
					of socio-cultural transformation,” he added. “Some countries that have made efforts in this regard,
					such as Japan, are excellent role models.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">In a <a href="https://rainlily.org.hk/chi/news/23/11/2012/-"><span><u>similar
								survey</u></span></a> conducted by the Gender-friendly Environment Group in 2012, about
					13 percent of the 537 respondents reported having witnessed a woman being sexually assaulted. Of
					these witnesses, fewer than a third, or 4 percent of the total respondents, reported having notified
					MTR staff at the time, and this statistic has remained essentially unchanged, being 3.6 percent in
					the most recent results. Wan attributed the low figure to bystanders’ concerns about being perceived
					as nosy and their uncertainty about whether an assault had actually taken place. “The predicament
					reflected [in these statistics] is that bystanders are unsure how to define sexual violence or to
					determine whether others are being harassed,” he explained.

				</script>

				<p class="lead">The formula “Sexual Innuendo + Reluctance = Sexual Violence” is prominent on the
					ACSVAW’s website. “Any intended or planned offense by an individual in terms of an act, language, or
					attitude with a sexual connotation regarding another person’s body that, irrespective of any prior
					relationship or the place in which it occurs, causes a feeling of fear, being threatened, or
					insulted constitutes an act of sexual violence,” the accompanying text explains.

				</p>

				<p class="lead"><a><img width="175" height="175" class="pull-right" alt="sample-image"
							src="images/sample-image2.png"></a>Wan suggested that the MTR Corporation could make some
					improvements to remedy passengers’ lack of knowledge of these issues. For instance, MTR conductors
					could discuss the prevention of sexual violence during announcements on trains. “Diversified options
					for support are also necessary, as the current single way—of waiting for the train to arrive at a
					station and then going to a customer service centre to ask staff for help—is inefficient,” Wan
					added. “The MTR could try opening up avenues of help for sexual violence in the MTR mobile app,
					which is already widely used.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">He then quoted a source that he considered reliable: “The MTR station area is a
					‘hard-hit’ area for sexual violence cases in Hong Kong, accounting for 14 percent of all indecent
					exposure cases and 36 percent of clandestine obscene filming cases, according to police data from
					2017 to 2019. Even though the status quo is severe,” he concluded, “the MTR Corporation has not
					responded positively to our proposal. But the ACSVAW will maintain focus on these issues and give
					voice to the community, including in necessary communication with subcommittees of the Legislative
					Council.”

				<h1>Professor Annie Chan: Sexual harassment is a form of sexual violcence</h1>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Legislation is required to prevent sexual harassment in public places.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p class="lead">Many acts of sexual harassment in public areas are not outlawed under the current <a
						href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap480"><span><u>sexual discrimination
								ordinance</u></span></a>, which applies only to educational institutions, workplaces,
					and places where services are provided.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“Technically, sexual harassment can only happen in these three contexts. The law
					covering sexual harassment does not cover a place like an MTR station,” said Annie Chan, a professor
					in the Department of Sociology and Social Policy at Lingnan University.

					</svg>The sexual discrimination ordinance does not cover the MTR station, explained Professor Annie

				</p>

				<p class="lead">Since the MTR station is a public and usually somewhat crowded area, it can be
					challenging for victims to identify the perpetrator when they experience sexual harassment or
					assault.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“A lot of women, when they experience sexual harassment, their default response is that
					they are suspicious of themselves. By the time they realize it has happened, it’s already too late,”
					Chan continued. “It is difficult to prove sexual harassment if it didn’t involve physical harm.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“Some victims think that it is not worth reporting such incidents because they have to
					convince people that this [sexual harassment] happened, and they might be seen as the person who is
					making a fuss,” she reasoned.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">In many cases, those who experience sexual harassment are responsible for being vigilant
					and reporting the incidents.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">“Instead of telling a woman not to tolerate sexual harassment, it is important to
					encourage bystanders to report the incident if they witness it,” Chan asserted.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					In any case, the type of harassment that occurs in MTR stations would be more apparent if it were a
					violation of criminal law. The citizens of Hong Kong need to be educated so as to understand that
					sexual harassment is a form of sexual violence.
				</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4208946">
					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">
					According to figures provided by the HKPF Railway District, reports of indecent exposure and upskirt
					photo-taking on MTR stations have remained fairly frequent over the past seven years, with the
					average number of incidents per year ranging from 109 to 147.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					However, victims often find it difficult to tell others about experiences of sexual harassment. At
					the beginning of the interview with her, when asked why she was willing to share her story, Winnie
					Wong Wai Yin revealed that she had been inspired when she saw that someone else was willing to speak
					up publicly and share her experiences on social media, namely Ho Ka Yau.

				<p class="lead">In October 2019, Ho shared her experiences of sexual harassment, both verbal and
					physical, on her Instagram page. She stressed that all people, including women, have the right to
					walk down the street without fear of sexual assault.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: What was your first experience of being sexually assaulted?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ho: The first time I remember it happening to me was in Form 2. During the rush hour
					after school, I was riding the subway when I felt a boy my age touching my upper body and buttocks.
					Since it was the first time it had happened to me, I was shaking with fear and got off the train
					early, but I didn’t pursue it after that.</p>

				<p class="lead">I once questioned myself whether I needed to scream for someone to help me at the time,
					for I was worried that people would challenge me because I didn’t have any proof that he had
					actually touched me, and I was even afraid that others might doubt that I would be sexually
					assaulted because I wasn’t pretty.
				</p>

				<aside class="pull-quote">
					<blockquote>
						<p>Awareness of society</p>
					</blockquote>
				</aside>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Based on your experience, do you think there is a lack of awareness of the problem
						in this society?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ho: I think so. I don’t think people are really aware of sexual assault and sexual
					violence. When the boy touched my chest and butt, I wondered if it was sexual assault and was unsure
					whether this was intentional or an accident. I kept looking at a woman sitting across from me,
					hoping she would help me. Though the lady saw what was going on, she didn’t say anything.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">[The problem is] not only bystanders’ attitudes but that they are also not aware of what
					is happening. They may not know what sexual assault is and that accosting someone can be a type of
					harassment. Many bystanders may not know the proper way to handle it. Therefore, you [the victim]
					are challenged to follow up. If you didn’t stop him or her [the perpetrator] at that moment when he
					or she was touching you, it is also difficult for bystanders to do anything.
				</p>

					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">The news content related to sexual harassment in three major Hong Kong media outlets
					increased over the period from 2016 to 2018, with a total of 471 such stories published in 2018, and
					then began to decline somewhat.</p>

				<aside class="pull-quote">
					<blockquote>
						<p>The “blame the victim” mentality and the nature of the criminal justice system in Hong Kong
							generally may lead victims to conclude that it is pointless to report sexual assault to the
							police.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</aside>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Do you think that so few victims seek help because people are in general reluctant
						to contact the police, or is the concern that victims will be blamed when they ask for help?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ho: I talked to people about what I faced when I was in secondary school, as I
					experienced quite a lot at that time. I conversed with my relatives, friends, teachers, and
					classmates. People often responded to me by asking how I dressed, how I acted, and whether I gave a
					wrong signal to others—and I didn’t understand how I could give a wrong signal to others. Most of
					them didn’t believe me. Even my closest friends and teachers challenged [my claim about experiencing
					sexual assault], so I think it is more difficult for bystanders to believe those who experience
					sexual harassment on the street.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">If I shouted out immediately when I was touched, maybe people would act and think the
					same way. If nobody helps me, it is difficult for me to stop the perpetrator from escaping. The
					system does not protect victims who are seeking help. Even if the victim calls the police, the
					police have to let the offender go if there are no witnesses [willing to come forward] and [no
					clear] evidence. So, I don’t think it’s useful to call the police; and bystanders’ lack of awareness
					of sexual assault makes it challenging for victims to seek help. The victims may be challenged by
					others, too.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Do you think the attitude of people has ever changed from time to time?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ho: I think it will take some time to motivate change regarding the concept of
					victim-blaming. As sexual violence implies various underlying issues, including gender…there are
					many aspects we can address, like changing the image [of sexual assault] on the part of the
					public—for example, raising awareness of what sexual assault is and not “blaming the victim.”
					Second, educate the public about what bystanders can do. There is much more to change in the
					public’s mind. Everyone can change and do something to help. Third, I think there is a need for the
					system to help follow up on these proposals.

				<h1>AN ANONYMOUS MALE VICTIM LIVING WITH MEMORIES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT</h1>

				<p class="lead">Sexual harassment is not, of course, limited to MTR stations; nor are all of the victims
					female. Thus, one male college student, who wished to remain anonymous, described his experience of
					sexual harassment in another public place, bars.
				</p>

				<p><img src="images/anonymous.jpg"></p>
				<p class="lead" style="font-size:80%; color:#737373; line-height:1.3"><svg
						xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true"
						focusable="false" width="1em" height="1em"
						style="-ms-transform: rotate(360deg); -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg); transform: rotate(360deg);"

					</svg>The victim described suffering physical and verbal sexual harassment, including unwanted
					attention in the bathroom. (Credit: Data Story)
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					“One of the unspoken rules of homosexuality is that you expect to be touched and flirted with by
					others,” the anonymous victim said in a self-deprecating manner after smoking. “I believe this is
					not only happening in some bars, but society as a whole.” This touching can involve the penis and
					buttocks; the accustomed response to such attention for someone who is not interested is to hide his
					hands but not to seek help.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">The anonymous individual interviewed for this story indicated that the reason for
					submissiveness in these situations is that the victim does not want to create strong memories of the
					abuse. Usually, victims are frightened when first encountering such behaviour and do not know how to
					react. However, when they seek help from a social worker or teacher, they are always asked to
					provide details. Then, in the process of recalling the assault as best they can, they experience
					secondary victimization.</p>

				<p class="lead">The anonymous victim expressed the opinion that Asian culture discourages sexual assault
					victims from speaking up. “Girls must be pure and truthful; if they are sexually harassed, they are
					contaminated,” he explained. Similarly, “Boys are masculine, and they should not be subjected to
					sexual harassment. To maintain a good image, they will not try to seek help.”
				</p>

				<p class="lead">He cited these as his reasons for not making his name and identity public and suggested
					that the parenting style in Hong Kong also contributed to this culture of silence.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">He mentioned verbal sexual harassment as well at bars. For example, passers-by asked,
					“Do you want to go to the bathroom [with me]?” or “I have a hotel room tonight; do you want to join
					us?” Such people usually gave up, he said, and went looking for the next target and the next victim.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					The anonymous victim had even encountered sexual harassment involving no physical or verbal contact,
					when a man followed him into the bathroom and, as he urinated, stood close to him, in defiance of
					the custom that men keep their distance at the urinal when possible. Glancing in the mirror as he
					washed his hands, he saw that the man had begun masturbating and, shocked immediately exited the
					bathroom.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Another form of sexual harassment that the anonymous victim decried was the posting of “sneak pics”
					on social media: “It’s disrespectful and violates people’s privacy.” These surreptitious photos of
					private body parts may end up online without the victims even knowing that their privacy has been
					violated. “It’s inevitable,” he lamented.

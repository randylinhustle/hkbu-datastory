				<p class="lead">In November, Tony Chan, a vendor on the sales platform, Carousell, was offering to sell
					face masks for $250 a box. He agreed to meet us at an MTR station to collect the cash. But one hour
					before the scheduled meeting time, Mr Chan stopped responding to our messages.</p>

				<p class="lead">The brand of mask Mr Chan was selling, Bedah Karet Masker, had been seized by Hong Kong
					Customs in April after tests showed it contains an excessive amount of bacteria.</p>

				<p class="jenny">Carousell is a Singapore-based online platform where users can buy and sell new or
					second-handed products. Apart from merchandise, it also offers tutoring services, properties and
					jobs. Counterfeit and prohibited products are supposedly not allowed, but there are no checks or
					enforcement procedures. There is also no specific regulation on the sale of face masks.</p>

				<p class="lead">"For masks, certification is not required, as long as they comply with the
					specifications in the <a

								rules</u></span></a> on Carousell," a customer service spokesperson from
					Carousell
					explained during a live online chat with us.</p>

				<p class="lead">The Bedah Karet Masker masks Tony Chan offered was one of 15 [identifiable] brands
					seized by Hong Kong Customs under "Guardian", <a
						href="https://www.customs.gov.hk/en/publication_press/press/index_id_2897.html"><span><u>an
								operation</u></span></a> in April this year to crack down on masks
					that did not comply with the Trade Description Ordinance. Since January, nearly 6 million masks have
					been confiscated by officers.</p>

				<p class="lead">In October, we found that seven vendors on Carousell were still offering the masks.
					After we reached out to them, some of them then marked the products as sold or removed them from
					Carousell. Most of them did not respond when we asked about hygiene issues. </p>

				<br><br>
				<h1>False product descriptions</h1>

				<p class="lead">Carousell also offers COVID-19 test kits. For example, one post claims that the <a

								COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test kit</u></span></a> has been approved by nine different
					health authorities, including
					the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, according to the latest filing report

					Ltd., <a
						href="https://fda.report/Company/Hangzhou-Clongene-Biotech-Co-L-T-D"><span><u>expired</u></span></a>
					more than seven months ago. Moreover, as of November 25, 2020, the FDA had <a

				</p>

				<p class="lead">Although Carousell claimed in the Listing Rules that product descriptions should be
					accurate on the platform or they would be removed, the Clungene COVID-19 test kit is still on sale
					in December, 2020.

				<h1>Listing rules designed to protect the platform</h1>


				<p class="lead">By law, medical masks sold in Hong Kong must comply with the <a
						href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap362?p0=1&p1=1"><span><u>Trade Description Ordinance
								(TDO)</u></span></a> and the <a
						href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap456"><span><u>Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance
								(CGSO)</u></span></a>.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Under the TDO, any person may not sell or possess goods that include a false
					description. According to CGSO, it is an offence to import, manufacture or supply consumer goods
					without complying with the general safety requirements for consumer goods. The maximum penalty for
					breaching these two ordinances is a fine of HK$100,000 and imprisonment for one year on a first
					conviction, and HK$500,000 and imprisonment for two years on a subsequent conviction. The public can
					report suspected violations of TDO or CGSO to the Customs Department. </p>

				<p class="lead">Masks being investigated by <a
						href="https://www.customs.gov.hk/en/publication_press/press/index_id_2922.html"><span><u>Hong
								Kong Customs</u></span></a> are tested at a laboratory for bacterial
					levels to see if they meet hygienic standards. If the products are labelled "NOT MADE IN CHINA'',
					"ASTM Level 1", or "BFE≥95%", the vendors must provide certificates or other documented proof.</p>

				<p class="lead">The standard to which Hong Kong Customs referred to determine whether face masks contain
					an excessive level of bacteria is the national hygienic standard for disposable sanitary products
					published by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine in China.
				</p>

				<p><img src="http://datastory.hkbu.edu.hk/images/carousell/bacteria1.png" data-action="zoom"></p>

				<p class="jenny">The number of bacteria found in the brand of masks customs officers seized was found to
					be 0.2 to 1.35 times above what is allowed by the standard.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">So far, Hong Kong Customs have mostly been targeting physical stores.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"There is, as far as I know, no particular law in Hong Kong regulating e-commerce
					platforms for the time being," said Eliza Xue, a lecturer at the Department of Accountancy and Law
					at Hong Kong Baptist University. "The applicable legislation, such as Consumer Goods Safety
					Ordinance and Trade Description Ordinance, are of a generic nature, regulating all on-market
					transactions including e-transactions."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">The Hong Kong Consumer Council is supposed to regulate both online and offline
					transactions. But online platforms based overseas, such as Carousell, are outside Hong Kong
					jurisdiction and enforcing Hong Kong law on them can be a lengthy process.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Patsy Moy, a practising barrister in Hong Kong, believes the liabilities should lie with
					the vendors rather than the platform. She cited two cases involving the sale of counterfeit and
					forgery products via Carousell. In both cases, Carousell was not held responsible for illegal
					conducts of the vendors.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"It looks to me that the <a
						href="https://support.carousell.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000689008-Listing-Rules"><span><u>Listing
								Rules</u></span></a> of Carousell are more to protect the platform
					from liabilities — to show it has exercised its due diligence to avoid civil or criminal
					liabilities," Ms Moy said, "however, enforcement is always an issue no matter how tight the rules
					are."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"Listings that do not comply with the listing rules will be removed from our platform,"
					Carousell claimed at the <a
						href="https://support.carousell.com/hc/zh-hk/articles/360000689008-%E7%94%A2%E5%93%81%E4%B8%8A%E8%BC%89%E5%AE%88%E5%89%87"><span><u>beginning
								of its Listing Rules</u></span></a>. In the Chinese version, it added that
					"monitors" are responsible for the supervision job. But how do they evaluate whether a product
					violates the listing rules? Why are the banned masks not removed from the platform? Do they know
					about hygiene issues? Carousell did not explain in detail but confirmed that the banned masks should
					not have been "allowed" on its platform after we reported the situation to them for a second time.
					The platform has since deleted all relevant products and promised to "take further action on the
					reported users as well."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">The platform has a <a
						href="https://support.carousell.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011190428-How-do-I-report-a-user-listing-"><span><u>reporting
								system</u></span></a> where users can anonymously report behaviours that
					violate the Listing Rules, such as the sale of prohibited items. The moderators from the platform
					would send the complainant a message after reviewing the submitted report.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">To test the efficiency of the mechanism, we posted a brand of the masks, Khatraco which
					has been banned in Hong Kong. We used photos from other vendors who have been selling them on the
					platform previously. Then we reported our account for "Selling prohibited items" using the reporting
					function on November 29, 2020. However, the platform told us that the product we reported did not
					violate the rules. By December 23, five out of the nine substandard masks we originally found on
					Carousell were still on sale.
				</p>

				<br><br>

				<h1>Who are the suppliers of unhygienic masks</h1>

				<p class="lead">Wang Shun Medicine Company in Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong offered Atos Mask, one of the brands
					banned by the Hong Kong Customs on its <a
						href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2757091607706945&id=1403753759707410"><span><u>Facebook</u></span></a>
					page in February. The masks were imported from
					Turkey and Wang Shun bought them via a wholesale company. But once they realised there was a hygiene
					problem, they vowed <a
						href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2785572418192197&id=1403753759707410"><span><u>on
								Facebook</u></span></a> never to work with the supplier again.</p>

				<p class="lead">Another vendor Cola, who was offering AD PRO FACE on Carousell responded to our messages
					via the platform. We asked her if she was aware of the brand's hygiene problems. "I don't know
					that," she asserted, "the company gave them [to me]." She said she had discarded the masks.</p>

				<p class="lead">But when we contacted Cola via Whatsapp under a different name, she agreed to sell us
					some AD PRO FACE masks. But once she realised there was a hygienic problem on our other chat, she
					offered to swap them for a different brand.</p>

				<p class="lead">Since some of the cases are still under the judicial process, a Customs spokesman was
					reluctant to divulge the exact type of bacteria found in the masks. But <a
						href="https://www.customs.gov.hk/tc/publication_press/press/index_id_2871.html"><span><u>Hong
								Kong Customs have warned</u></span></a> have
					warned the public that wearing masks that contain an excessive amount of bacteria may cause facial
					skin discomfort. For the elderly, children and people with weak immunity, inhalation of bacteria may
					easily cause airway infection.</p>

				<p class="lead">Wong has experienced sexual harassment on multiple occasions, recalling one of those
					times when she was in secondary school. </p>

				<p class="lead"><a><img width="150" height="150" class="pull-right" alt="sample-image"
							src="images/sample-image.jpg"></a>"I was on my way home from school and took the MTR from
					Kowloon Tong station to Tai Wai. I was listening to music, so I didn't pay much attention to my
					surroundings.
					Abruptly, I noticed something rubbing against my clothes and at first thought it might be some
					lady's carry-on. Still, I felt odd as the 'touch' was rhythmic. When I turned around, I saw a man
					behind
					me," Wong recollected.</p>

				<p class="lead">She continued, "I was startled, so I just stared at him instead of reacting, then
					immediately left the train."</p>

				<p class="lead">"I am furious and regret that the incident was not reported at the time. There may be
					other girls who have suffered the same sexual harassment as I have, but also did not report it,"
					said Wong.</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/4015368">
					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">Under the government's rail-led transport policy, The Mass Transit Railway, or MTR, is a
					common mode of the public transport network serving Hong Kong, with over five million trips made in
					an average weekday. Among them, Island Line, Tsuen Wan Line and East Rail Line have over 1 million
					weekday patronage, based on data from September 1 to 27, 2014.</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/4011509"
					data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4011509/embed" aria-label="">
					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">Analyzing the news reports about sexual violence in MTR stations by selected media in
					Hong Kong over the past 6 years, sexual violence frequently occurred in Admiralty, Prince Edward,
					Wanchai and Kowloon Tong stations, with the frequency of the first two being nearly 30.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Aside from MTR, this wasn't the only time Wong has been sexually harassed. She's also
					experienced incidents on the bus and bike path.</p>

				<p class="lead">In instances, those who experienced sexual harassment were blamed for the incident.
					When she called her friend for help after a man sexually harassed her, Wong recounted her memories,
					"My friend told me not to wear a short skirt to minimize the chances of sexual harassment." </p>

				<p class="lead">"Though, I'm keen to wear short skirts and drink with my buddies until midnight. Does
					this
					mean that men can sexually assault me? It is ridiculous," said Wong. </p>

					</svg>Winnie Wong is not shy about sharing her experience. (Credit: Data Story)
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Wong believes that more victims are now willing to open up about their experiences after
					the last year's social movement, however, there are downsides. "I think there are more people who
					encounter sexual
					harassment. Because the police aren't trusted anymore, people who are scheming may think we won't
					report it even if we've been harmed, and they may not have any
					consequences." She worries the cases will get worse.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Wong suggested the government could increase the penalties for crimes; moreover,
					non-profit organizations can also provide more banners and posters for the children. For example,
					the End Child Sexual Abuse Foundation could educate children to speak
					up and ask for help immediately. In her experience, nothing could be done after it happened.</p>

				<p class="lead">When asked why Wong was willing to share her experience with the <i>Story</i>, she
					answered
					with an
					awkward smile. </p>

				<p class="lead">"It is a bit embarrassing to say...Do you know who Ho Ka Yau is?" she asked, "I
					was inspired by her after viewing some of her passages on social media."
				</p>

				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ho is also actively involved in sexual harassment awareness-raising in Hong Kong. Her
					personal Instagram page has more than 19,000 followers, as the YouTube channel "番號ABC" co-hosted by
					Yuen Ka Wai and Wong Siu Chui has about 15,000 followers, sharing their views on sex and sexual
					relationships.

				<p class="lead">At the end of October 2019, Ho shared her story on her Instagram page - she experienced
					sexual harassment, both verbally and physically. She stressed that not only women, but anyone has
					the right to walk down the street without the constant fear of being sexually assaulted.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: What was your first experience of being sexually assaulted?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ho: The first time I remember it happening to me was in Form 2. It was during rush hour
					after school and I was riding the subway when I felt a boy my age touching my upper body and
					buttocks. Since it was the first time it had happened to me, I was shaking in fear and got off the
					train early, but I didn't pursue it after that.</p>

				<p class="lead">I once questioned myself if I needed to scream for someone to help me at the time. Yet,
					I was worried that people would challenge me because I didn't have any proof that he had actually
					touched me, and I was even feared that others might doubt how would I be sexually assaulted because
					I wasn't pretty.

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: From your experience, do you think there is a lack of awareness in this
						society?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ho: I think so. I don't deem people are really aware of sexual assault and sexual
					violence. When the boy touched my chest and butt, I wondered if it was sexual assault and I was not
					sure if this was intentionally or accidentally. I kept looking at a woman sitting across from me
					hoping she could help me, she saw what was going on but didn't say anything.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Not only bystanders' attitude, but they are also not aware of what is happening. They
					may not know what is sexual assault, and that accosting can be a type of harassment. Many bystanders
					may not know a proper way to handle it. Therefore, you [the victim] are challenged to follow up, if
					you didn't stop him or her at that moment when he/she was touching you, it is also difficult for
					bystanders to do anything.

						<p>From the social perception of "blame the victim" to
							the system in Hong Kong, victims may find there is no use to say out or call the police.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</aside>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Do you think that victims who don't ask for help are as a result of the low number
						of people asking for help in general, or they will face "victim-blaming" when they ask for
						help?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ho: I talked to people about what I faced when I was in secondary school, as I
					experienced quite a lot at that time. I conversed to my relatives, friends, teachers and classmates.
					People often responded to me by asking how I dressed, how I acted, and whether I gave a wrong signal
					to others, which I don't understand how I can give a wrong signal to others. Most of them don't
					believe me. Even my closest friends and teachers challenged me [on experiencing indecent assault],
					so I think it is more difficult for bystanders to believe those who experienced sexual harassment on
					the street.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"> If I shout out immediately when I was touched, maybe people would act and think the
					same way. If nobody helps me, it is difficult for me to stop the perpetrator from escaping. The
					system does not protect victims from seeking help. Even if the victim calls the police, the police
					can only let the offender go without witnesses and evidence. So, I don't think it's useful to call
					the police, and the lack of awareness of sexual assault by bystanders makes it tough for victims to
					seek help. The victims may be challenged by others too.
				</p>

				<p class="lead"><b>Q: Do you think the attitude of people has ever changed from time to time?</b>
				</p>

				<p class="lead"> Ho: I think it is going to take some time to motivate or change the concept of
					victim-blaming. As sexual violence implies different issues behind, including gender…there are many
					aspects we can do, like changing the concepts of the public. For example, offer awareness-raising on
					what sexual assault is and how to be not 'blaming the victim'. Second, educate the public about what
					the bystanders can do. There is much more to change in the public's mind. Everyone can change and do
					something to help. Third, I think there is a need for the system to help follow up on these.

				<p class="lead">A recent online survey conducted by Gender-friendly Environment Group on public
					experience of encountering or witnessing sexual violence in MTR over the past three years, of which
					419 valid responses were collected. The study found that 72 per cent of the respondents had
					experienced sexual violence in MTR stations, including being unnecessarily touched or rubbed, and
					over 90 per cent said the incident happened in the train compartment.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"There is often an accusation made in the society that these victims should immediately
					speak up and call for help from those around them, but the fact is that the people involved refuse
					to resist because of the immense fear they feel," said Oskar Wan, the Community Organiser of the
					Association. "The key, therefore, is for bystanders to be able to step in and intervene, which is
					the quickest and most effective way to do so," he said.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Wan believes that the MTR Corporation has not attempted to promote or educate the
					public about the "active bystander" initiative, a gap that needs to be filled urgently. "Such
					advocacy can lead to the creation of a positive atmosphere of mutual help and assistance, which is a
					kind of socio-cultural transformation," Wan added, "Some countries that have made efforts in this
					regard, such as Japan, are excellent role models."

				<p class="lead">In a <a href="https://rainlily.org.hk/chi/news/23/11/2012/-"><span><u>similarly-themed
								survey</u></span></a> initiated by the Group in 2012, about 13 per cent of the 537
					respondents had witnessed a woman being sexually assaulted, but only 3 of them [4 per cent] had
					notified MTR staff at the time. Yet, that number made no progress in this year's results, remaining
					at 3.6 per cent. Wan explains that the low figure is because bystanders have their concerns; some
					are fearful of being accused of being nosy, while others are unsure whether the person was assaulted
					or not. "The predicament reflected is that bystanders are unsure how to define sexual violence and
					how to determine whether others are being harassed," he said.

					could add content on preventing sexual violence during live in-train announcements, thereby acting
					as a deterrent to some extent. "Diversified options for support are also necessary, as the current
					single way of waiting for the train to arrive at a station and then going to a Customer Service
					Centre to ask staff for help is too inefficient," Wan added, "MTR could try opening up avenues of
					help for sexual violence in the MTR Mobile app, which is already widely used."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"The MTR station area is the 'hard hit' area for sexual violence cases in Hong Kong,
					accounting for 14 per cent of all indecent assault cases and 36 per cent of clandestine obscene
					filming cases, according to police data from 2017 to 2019", he quoted, "Even though the status quo
					is
					severe, the MTR Corporation has not responded positively to our proposal. "
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"But the Association will continue to maintain its focus on such issues and deliver the
					voice of the community, including necessary communication with the Legislative Council
					Subcommittees," Wan added.

				<h1>Professor Annie Chan: It is not just sexual harassment, it is a form of sexual violcence</h1>

				<blockquote>
					<p>There is a need of jurisdiction to prevent sexual harassment in public area </p>
				</blockquote>

				<p class="lead">Legally, many of the victims who encounter sexual harassment in public area, for
					example, MTR were not protected under the sexual discrimintaion ordinance. The <a
						href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap480"><span><u>sexual discrimination
								ordinance </u></span></a> only covered the context of education institution, employment
					workplaces and services
					provision area.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"Technically, sexual harassment can only happend in these three context. The law that
					covers sexual harassment does not actually covers a place like MTR station," said Professor Annie
					Chan, Associate Professor from Department of Sociology and Social Policy, Lingnan University.
				</p>


				<p class="lead">Since MTR is a public space and usually a very crowded area, it is difficult for victims
					to identified the harassment when a suspected sexual harassment or sexual assault occurerd to them.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"A lot of women, when they experience sexal harassment, their default response is that
					they will doubt themself, by the time they realize it has actually happened, it's already too late,"
					says Prof Chan.
				</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4039253"

					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">Viewing the news content related to sexual harassment in three selected Hong Kong local
					media from 2016 to 2019, the number of stories is on an overall upward trend in the first three
					years, with a total of 471 relevant news published in 2018.</p>

				<p class="lead">It is difficult to prove sexual harassment as it wasn't really involve physical harm,
					what is bodily injury, Prof Chan added.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Some victims think that it is not worth to report such incident because they have to
					convince people that this [sexual harassment] had happend and they might be seen as the person who
					is making a fuss, says Prof Chan.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">In many cases, those who experienced sexual harassment were placed with a responsiblity
					that they have to be vigilent and report the incidents.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"Instead of telling a woman not to tolerate sexual harassment, it is important to
					encourage bystanders to report the incident if they witness it," said Prof Chan.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					It will be clearer if this type of harassment in MTR is a violation of criminal law. There is a need
					to tell people that this is not just harassment because it is a form of sexual violence.

				<h1>Anonymous victim: Recalling memories imposed a second-degree injury to victims</h1>

				<p class="lead">Sexual harassment is not limited to MTR stations. One college student, who did not want
					to be named, described sexual harassment in a public place.
				</p>

				<p><img src="images/anonymous.jpg"></p>

					</svg>The victim described his experiences of suffering from sexually harassment physically,
					verbally and distantly. (Credit: Data Story)
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					"One of the unspoken rules of homosexuality is that you expected to be touched or flirted with by
					others," the anonymous person said in a self-deprecating manner after smoking shisha, "I believe
					this is not happening in some bars, but in society as a whole". He believes the above is the culture
					- they will touch private body parts such as the penis and buttocks. Still, his action is to put
					their hands away to show that he is not interested, but not seeking help.
				</p>


				<p class="lead">The anonymous mentioned that the reason for submissiveness is that the victim does not
					want to recall the memories. Usually, the victim is scared and frightened when they first encounter
					the situation and they may not know what to do at the time. However, when they ask for help, the
					social worker or teacher will always ask for more details. At that time, the victim should try to
					recall the situation as best they can, which could lead them to secondary victimization.</p>

				<p class="lead">In addition to its submissive traits, the anonymous believes that Asian culture also
					keeps victims from speaking up after being sexually harassed. "Girls must be pure and truthful, if
					they are sexually harassed, they are contaminated," this is implied to boys as well, "Boys are
					masculine and they should not be subjected to sexual harassment. In order to maintain a good image,
					they will not try to seek help."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">These are the reasons why he refuses to reveal his name and identity to the public. He
					believes Hong Kong's parenting style also contributes to this culture.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Sexual harassment is verbally serious as well. He encountered some flirty words at the
					bar. For example, he was asked, "Do you want to go to the bathroom [with me]?", "I have a hotel room
					tonight", "Do you want to join us?" Surprisingly, they were all strangers and passersby. As he
					observed, those people usually gave up. Instead of sticking to one person, they would walk around
					looking for the next target - to become the next victim.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					It was never the end of the nightmare. He even encountered sexual harassment without physical
					contact or a word being said. Once, a man followed him to the bathroom and when he urinated, the man
					stood right next to him, which he thought was strange because men don't usually stand next to each
					other, especially if there's a lot of space. When he looked in the mirror while washing his hands,
					he saw in the reflection that the man was masturbating and immediately rushed out of the toilet in
					shock.

				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Another circumstance he cannot tolerate is people posting sneak pics on social media. "It's
					disrespectful and violates people's privacy," the anonymous asserted. Nonetheless, these are not
					ordinary photos, some of
					which are close-up shots and highlight specific body parts that would allow someone to undress
					someone with their eyes. However, the victims did not know their image was being taken until they
					saw
					the photos online. "Still, this is inevitable," he said helplessly.

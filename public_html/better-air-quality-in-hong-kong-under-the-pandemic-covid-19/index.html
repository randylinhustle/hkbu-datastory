    <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left"> COVID-19 influences the economic activities in the whole world and changes people’s lifestyle. The global economic activities reduce significantly like the lockdown in China in which factories stopped to work. In Hong Kong, according to the Air Traffic Statistic recorded by Hong Kong International Airport, there are significant decreases in the number of passengers, cargo handled and flight movements which drop 98.5%, 5.7% and 68.3% respectively comparing the same period in October in 2019 and 2020.  </p>
      
      <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">People’s lifestyle changes like going to school or company to work switch to online classes and work from home, hence it prompts people to use less traffic transportation which helps to reduce the production of air pollutants.  </p>
        
        <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left"> Combined with the external and internal factors, Hong Kong seems to have fewer activities in different aspects that makes the air quality in Hong Kong improve. However, is the air quality in Hong Kong really improved by these reasons? </p>

    <p class="my-3 head" >AQHI is reported hourly by the Environmental Protection Department. 
      The charts show the number of hours recorded with different rankings of AQHI per month in 15 general stations in Hong Kong. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">Comparing the General Air Quality Health Index in 2019 and 2020, the proportion of the AQHI recorded in Low ranking in May to October in 2020 was higher than that of the same period of time in 2019. There were 5 months in 2019 (July to November) had recorded AQHI in Serious level while there were 2 months in 2020 (April and September) had recorded AQHI in Serious level. Also, this year has less record of AQHI in High and Very High level.
         It indicates that the air quality in this year is averagely better than last year.</p></div>

          <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left" >The air quality monitors are set at the roadside in Causeway Bay, Central and Mong Kok. People who stay or work on the street all day like site workers should be 
            aware of this index to take certain actions to protect health.  </p>
       
            <br>

          <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">Comparing the Roadside Air Quality Health Index in 2019 and 2020, it is the same as the General Air Quality Health Index that the proportion of the AQHI recorded in Low ranking in May to October in 2020 is higher than that of the same period of time in 2019. From January to October in 2020, there is no record for the AQHI in Serious level while the AQHI in Serious level is recorded 
            in August and September in 2019 respectively. </p>
       
            <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">It seems that Air Quality Health Index recorded in both general and roadside stations are mainly in Low and Moderate Ranking in this year and it is less in High, Very High or Serious level compared to in 2019. </p>

            <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">However, Dr Nagi Ka Po, the program leader of Higher Diploma in Environmental Protection and Management in Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education and professional in air quality study, comments that although “year 2020 has recorded more 'Low' AQHI ranking in May, September and October, and more 'Moderate' ranking in Feb”, 
              there are still other factors impact the air quality in Hong Kong. </p>
              
              <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">Nagi gives an example for the case in September 2020, “For the September case, that’s probably due to heavy rains that remove the air pollutants from the air. There is a significantly more number of days with rainfall greater than 25 mm in 2020 compared to 2019.”</p>

An AAQI greater than one indicates that the health risk resulting from long-term exposure is higher than that of the WHO's annual AQG, whereas an index below one means a lower risk. The ratio of concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respirable suspended particulates (PM10) and fine suspended particulates (PM2.5) are recorded in AAQI.</p>

<p class="my-3 head" style="text-align: left">
  The charts of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 show the data of the AAQI recorded in both general station and roadside station. The trend of the concentration of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 in air are declining which means Hong Kong has fewer concentrations of air pollutants in air.  </p>
<p class="my-3 head" style="text-align: left"> Although the trend of AAQI is dropping, the latest concentration of air pollutants recorded by roadside station monitors are higher than 1 which means the air quality in Hong Kong is still above the air quality standard of WHO. People have higher risk to have health problems if they always have long-term exposure on the roadside.  </p>
<p class="my-3 head" style="text-align: left"> Some of the general station monitors were unavailable to record the concentration of air pollutants in some period of time because the monitors were damaged and also there are no records for the North and South districts as the latest monitor was set up in July 2020. </p>

        <h3 class="head">Implementation of green policy</h3>
        <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left"> Indeed, the pandemic reduces a lot of air-pollutants-generated-activities like the decrease in traffic transportation. The policies of the government implemented previously also contribute to the improvement of air quality. </p>
          <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">Dr Nagi, the professionals in air quality study mentions that the Environmental Protection Department has implemented several green policies like promoting green transportation such as the development of new rail networks. </p>
          <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">“The development of a new rail network may also play a role, as the mode of public transport seems to be changed like shifting from bus, mini-bus to MTR. Air emission sources are then shifting from mobile to stationary sources,” Ngai said. </p>
            <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">Also, there are more stringent policy on emission level for power plants and the policy of encouraging the cleaner production in Guangdong factories which also facilitates the improvement of air quality in Hong Kong</p>
      <br>
            <h3 class="head">Generation of electricity power</h3>
            <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">There is a trend that the concentration of air pollutants is reduced due to people using less traffic transportation like buses and planes and spending more time to stay at home, but Nagi comments that the pollutants generated by electronic devices cannot be ignored. </p>

     <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">“Reduced traffic volume would of course reduce certain kinds of air pollutant emission (e.g NO2), but we may just on the other hand use more power at home due to online activities. It also depends on the energy mix of our power generation. If there is a higher percentage of renewable energy then the air quality could be improved,” Nagi said. </p>
   
    <img src="assets/images/fuel.png" width="600" height="250">
  
     <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">According to the Environment Bureau website, the distribution of the fuel mix for power generation are coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, oils and renewables and pumped storage arranged descendingly.</p>

     <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">Source:  The Census and Statistics Department</p>
     <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">Although the main source of energy of power generation is coal, Hong Kong people generate less electricity in the first three quarters in 2020 compared to the same period of time in 2018 and 2019. </p>
     <p class="my-3 head" style="text-align:left">For the sustainable future to improve air quality and reduce pollutants, people can try the green lifestyle like having more public transportation service instead of personalised transport and reducing energy consumption at home like turning off the fan when you do not use it. </p>

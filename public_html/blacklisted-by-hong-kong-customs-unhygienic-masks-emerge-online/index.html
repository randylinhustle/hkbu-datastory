				<p class="lead">"I wore the face mask to shield myself from the invasion of COVID-19, but I felt
					extremely nauseous when I put that one on," said Long Jiawei, 22, a fourth-year student of
					Organizational Communication at Hong Kong Baptist University, recalling his encounter with a mask he
					acquired in February.</p>

				<p class="lead">Long stressed that a mask named "BRE-EASY" has been a long-term nightmare for him, not
					only filled with this pungent smell but also incredibly flimsy. "While wearing it, I felt dizzy and
					sometimes even got shortness of breath," added Long, who asked a trusted friend to buy a box of 50
					masks worth HK$300 from a dealer at the beginning of the global epidemic. </p>

				<p class="lead">A shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) erupted in the wake of the sudden
					onslaught of the novel coronavirus, for a time, many citizens were scrambling to purchase masks and
					alcohol-based disinfectants to protect against the virus. Yet, a batch of substandard masks also
					emerged quietly on the market then.</p>

				<p class="lead">To crack down on non-compliant medical surgical masks on the market, the Hong Kong
					Customs launched a large-scale territory-wide special operation code-named "<a
						href="https://www.customs.gov.hk/en/publication_press/press/index_id_2850.html"><span><u>Guardian</u></span></a>"
					from January
					27th. The action has so far seized nearly 6 million masks that violate the regulations, among which
					we can identify 15 brands, including the "<a
						href="https://www.customs.gov.hk/en/publication_press/press/index_id_2871.html"><span><u><b>BRE-EASY</b></u></span></a>"
					that Long bought earlier.</p>

				</div>

				<p class="lead">Of the 15 identifiable masks, 10 were tested for excessive bacteria levels, and most of
					them were not packaged with an indication of origin, but were investigated from countries in
					Southeast Asia or West Asia, according to the Customs' press releases.</p>

				<p class="lead">Seven months after the problem masks were asked to be removed from stores, we found four
					of them on sale on an online platform called Carousell, including <a

				</p>

				<p class="jenny">Early in October, we found seven vendors selling the banned masks on Carousell. All the
					masks were posted as "on-sale" when we found them. But after we reached out to them as customers,
					some vendors marked the products as sold or removed from the website. The same thing happened when
					we messaged them about hygiene issues. Only the vendor who sells <b>AD PRO FACE MASK</b> replied.

				<h1>Who takes the risk of selling unhygienic masks?</h1>

				<p class="lead">"The box of masks you chose was tested exceeding the bacterial limit by the Customs in
					May." "May I change another one for you?" <a
						href="https://www.carousell.com.hk/coke1230/"><span><u>Cola</u></span></a>, the vendor who sold
					<b>AD PRO FACE MASK</b> on
					Carousell,
					sent two WhatsApp messages to one of us, who pretended to buy the product. </p>

				<p class="lead">Earlier that day, we used another account to ask Cola whether she knew that there were
					hygiene problems with her mask via message on Carousell. "I don’t know," she said. "The company gave
					it (to me) previously." When we continued to ask for pictures of the box of the mask, she replied
					that she had thrown it away in the trash bin on the street. </p>


				<p class="lead">The product was removed from Carousell immediately after we contacted Cola about that.
					However, she later agreed to sell the mask to the other account of ours on WhatsApp, as we told her
					that we would use the mask for drawing.</p>


				<p class="lead">Tony Chan is another vendor on Carousell whose primary sales are surgical masks,
					including <b>Masker Bedah Karet</b>, one suspected of exceeding the bacteria limit listed by Hong
					Kong
					Customs.</p>

				<h1>What is the hygiene problem in the masks?
				</h1>

				<p class="lead">The Customs admitted to us that the sanitary standard they refer to for inspection is
					<a href="http://www.gb688.cn/bzgk/gb/newGbInfo?hcno=C962DEDB5BD3A372CE69ADAEFA0273A5"><span><u>GB
								15979-2002</u></span></a>. It is the national hygienic standard for disposable sanitary
					products published
					by the
					General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of
					China.

					</svg>The national standard suggests the upper limit of bacteria contained in surgical
					masks.<br>(Source: Code of China: GB15979-2002 Hygienic Standard for Disposable Sanitary Products)
				</p>

				<p class="jenny">In this official standard, regarding surgical masks, it mentions that the upper limit
					of
					bacteria contained should be 20 cfu/g [colony-forming unit per gram].
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Based on the test results of the latest batch of 24 test-purchased surgical mask samples
					received by the Customs, the total bacterial counts of samples of four types of surgical masks
					exceeded the maximum permitted limit by 0.2 to 1.35 times.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">However, as the case is still under judicial process, the Customs hold reservations in
					revealing the exact type of bacteria contained in the listed surgical masks.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"During private investigations, the public have no right to obtain the full list of
					those unqualified surgical masks," the Customs responded, "and medical testing report is also not
					allowed to disclose as it contains non-public information."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">The Hong Kong Customs reminded that long-term wearing of surgical masks with excessive
					bacterial
					content may cause facial skin discomfort. For the elderly, children and people with weaker immunity,
					inhalation of bacteria may easily cause airway infection, posing potential risks on their health.
				</p>

				<br><br>
				<h1>Who is liable: Carousell or the Vendors?
				</h1>

				<p class="lead">According to a <a
						href="https://www.customs.gov.hk/en/publication_press/press/index_id_2922.html"><span><u>press
								release</u></span></a> by the Hong Kong Customs on May 22, medical masks sold in
					Hong Kong must comply with the <a
						href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap362?p0=1&p1=1"><span><u>Trade Description Ordinance
								(TDO)</u></span></a> and <a
						href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap456"><span><u>the
								Customs Goods Safety Ordinance (CGSO)</u></span></a>.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Under TDO, any person may not sell or possess goods that include a false description.
					According to CGSO, it is an offence to import, manufacture or supply consumer goods without
					complying with the general safety requirements for consumer goods. The maximum penalty of these two
					ordinances upon conviction is a fine of HK$100,000 and imprisonment for one year on a first
					conviction, and HK$500,000 and imprisonment for two years on a subsequent conviction. The public can
					report suspected violations of TDO or CGSO to the Customs.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">For masks under investigation, the Customs will send the test-bought samples to the
					laboratory for tests on bacterial counts to see whether it meets hygienic standard. If not, it
					potentially violates CGSO. They will also ask the vendors to provide certificates or prove the
					authentication of the labels on the masks, which usually claims "NOT MADE IN CHINA'', "ASTM Level
					1", or "BFE≥95%". If the vendors are not able to provide the related certificate, they are
					potentially violating TDO.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">However, the investigation of masks by Hong Kong Customs are mostly targeting physical
					medical supplies shops. For online platforms like Carousell, the unhygienic masks are still on sale.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"There is, as far as I know, no particular law in Hong Kong regulating e-commerce
					platforms for the time being," Ms. Eliza Xue, lecturer of Department of Accountancy and Law at Hong
					Kong Baptist University told us. "The applicable legislation, such as Consumer Goods Safety
					Ordinance and Trade Description Ordinance, are of a generic nature, regulating all on-market
					transactions including e-transactions."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">According to Ms. Xue, the government body that regulates both online and offline
					transactions is the Consumer Council. Online platforms like Carousell are companies that stand in
					the middle between the vendors and consumers. Thus, these companies would be jointly liable to
					consumers if it is found that the products on sale on their platform do not meet the standard.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ms. Patsy Moy, practising barrister in Hong Kong, has a different opinion regarding
					liabilities in this case. From her point of view, the liabilities are more on the vendor than the
					platform. She cited two cases involving the sale of counterfeit and forgery via Carousell. In both
					cases, Carousell is not responsible for any illegal conducts of the vendors.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Ms. Moy also gave opinions about the <a
						href="https://support.carousell.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000689008-Listing-Rules"><span><u>Listing
								Rules
							</u></span></a> of Carousell. "It looks to me that
					the rules are more to protect the platform from liabilities - to show it has exercised its due
					diligence to avoid civil or criminal liabilities," Ms. Moy said, "however, enforcement is always an
					issue no matter how tight the rules are formulated."
				</p>

				<br><br>
				<h1>How does Carousell detect substandard products?
				</h1>

				<p class="lead">"Listings that do not comply with the listing rules will be removed from our platform,"
					Carousell claimed at the beginning of its Listing Rules. In the Chinese version, it added that
					"monitors" are responsible for the supervision job. But how do they evaluate whether a product
					violates the listing rules? Why are the banned masks not removed from the platform yet? Do they know
					about hygiene issues? We asked Carousell about these questions. The platform replied that they "have
					escalated the issue to the Escalation Team for further investigation" and would keep us updated.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">The platform holds a <a
						href="https://support.carousell.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011190428-How-do-I-report-a-user-listing-"><span><u>reporting
								system
							</u></span></a> where users can anonymously report behaviours
					violating the Listing Rules including selling prohibited items. The moderators from the platform
					would send the complainer a message after reviewing the submitted report.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">To test the efficiency of the mechanism, we posted one of the banned masks called
					Khatraco on Carousell, using photos from other vendors who have sold it there before. And we
					reported our account for "Selling prohibited items" using the reporting function. It’s been 7 days
					but neither the moderators nor the platform contacted us.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">We also reported the vendor who agreed to sell a box of <b>Bedah Karet Masker</b> masks
					to us
					on Carousell for HK$250. We pretended to be a customer who bought the product in March. The platform
					replied but only asked for more details as they could not find any trading record.

				<h1>Are there other substandard medical products on Carousell?</h1>

				<p class="lead">Apart from safety and quality issues, we also found that the product descriptions of
					some COVID-19 test kits sold on Carousell are misleading or even include false information.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">For example, it is said in <a

								product description</u></span></a> of CLUNGENE COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid
					test kit that the product is listed under the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
					registration. However, according to the latest filing report on FDA official website, the
					registration of the manufacturer, HANGZHOU CLONGENE BIOTECH CO., LTD., <a
						href="https://fda.report/Company/Hangzhou-Clongene-Biotech-Co-L-T-D"><span><u>has
								expired</u></span></a> more than seven

								reviewed nor authorized</u></span></a> the CLUNGENE COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid
					test kit by November 25 2020.
				</p>
				<p class="lead">Although Carousell claimed in the Listing Rules that product description should be
					accurate on the platform or else the product would be removed from the platform, the above-mentioned
					COVID-19 test kit is still on sale by December 2020.

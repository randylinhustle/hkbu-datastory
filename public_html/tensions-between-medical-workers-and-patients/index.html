                                a wave of outpouring anger among the public. On 28 December 2019,
                                <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2019-12/29/content_5464861.htm">China’s first fundamental and comprehensive law on basic medical and health
                care services</a>&nbsp;was approved by the Standing Committee of the National People’s
                                Congress. The proposed law would be executed from June 1st, 2020. It emphasizes
                                that the whole society should make every effort to protect the medical
                                staff from violent attacks and anyone who breaks the law would receive
                                strict punishment.
                                <br>
                                <br>Villion, who is a lawyer, explains that the new law mainly serves as a
                                deterrent, as there are no differences in sentencing before and after the
                                execution of the law.
                                <br>
                                <br>Another lawyer, Wang Dong Mei, who is a member of the NPC as well, explains
                                that “the violent behaviors against physicians and nurses are definitely
                                criminal cases. The criminal law is used widely in these cases as an after-event
                                penalty. But what urgently needed is the law and regulation for beforehand
                                prevention. That's the effect of this new set of regulations.”&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>On March 26, 2020, a new regulation of the security management in hospitals
                                in Beijing was submitted to the Standing Committee of the NPC for hearing.
                                The regulation rules that all the hospitals in Beijing should set police
                                rooms to protect the safety of medical staff. At the same time, it specifies
                                behaviors that are prohibited in hospitals, like assaulting medical personnel
                                and carrying knives and flammable and explosive materials. Thus the regulation
                                can protect the safety of the medical staff on an institutional level.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>“Reflective measures that have been taken in Beijing are influential for
                                the whole country since it is the political and economic center of China,”
                                said Wang.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Pudding, a medical supervisor who works for a medical company, shows his
                                negative attitude toward the targeting legislation. He thinks the point
                                is the enforcement of the law, but not the legislation. “Taking drunk driving
                                as an example, everyone knows it’s illegal, but only after the drunk drivers
                                are arrested strictly, people begin to attach importance to it.” &nbsp;</b>

                            <b>For Mrs. Mu, the mother of an 8-year-old girl, her thoughts are different
                                from doctors. Shen thinks for patients and their families, sometimes they
                                are vulnerable groups compared to doctors and other medical staff in some
                                cases.

                                <br>She told about the experience of her daughter who has been taken to a
                                hospital in Zhejiang Province after feeling collywobbles for a long period.
                                “I didn’t mean to find fault, but I was really annoyed by what the doctor
                                did at that time,” said Mrs. Mu.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Facing the tough and emergency situation, anxious parents chose to register
                                a relatively more expensive specialist to prove the accuracy of diagnosis.
                                Their daughter was diagnosed with a kind of stomach disease. &nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>After two weeks of observation and taking medicine, the girl did not take
                                a turn for the better, so the parents took the girl to the other doctor,
                                Chen, to check. But Chen refused to add a quota contemporarily for the
                                girl despite she was her patient. At the same time, she agreed to add a
                                quota for the other patients. In addition, the doctor rebuffed the demand
                                of parents that she would explain the reason for the symptom.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Mrs. Mu was enraged by the situation and complained to the relative bureau
                                of the hospital. However, her complaint received no response. The security
                                department of the hospital told Mrs. Mu that the doctor had the right to
                                decide if she would add a quota for someone. “But I think she didn’t treat
                                my daughter equally,” said Mrs. Mu, “since she chose to add a quota for
                                the other patient while my daughter was waiting there.”&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Liu is another person who complained about her experience of seeking medical
                                advice during the outbreak of COVID-19.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>She has suffered from slightly breathing difficulties for a long time.
                                In February, after the outbreak of COVID-19 took a turn for the better,
                                she went to a tertiary hospital in Dalian and booked a doctor of respiratory
                                medicine department.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>After waiting for about 1 hour, she entered the inquiry room and saw the
                                doctor. She described her symptoms to the doctor detailedly, but only received
                                a query from the doctor.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>“You are really young. I don’t think you may have some illnesses.” said
                                the doctor. But she did not elaborate on the reason for her symptoms. “Maybe
                                you just lack practice.” The doctor thought for a while and made a conjecture
                                without any substantive suggestions.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Under Liu’s repeated requests, the doctor agreed Liu do chest radiography.
                                Another two hours of waiting passes, when Liu brought the chest radiography
                                and reported back to the doctor, the doctor did not even check the X-ray
                                film.&nbsp;

                                <br>“She just read the report sketchily and concluded that there’s nothing
                                wrong with my respiratory system.” said Liu, “I was a little annoyed not
                                because I didn’t get any effective diagnosis, but it is because she didn’t
                                treat me with any graveness. She concluded that it was my anxiety that
                                made me uncomfortable without checking my chest radiography.”&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Liu still suffers from chest distress and shortness of breath until now.&nbsp;

                                <br>Cases mentioned above are what sometimes could happen during and after
                                the treatment. Two different systems of thoughts exist in doctors’ and
                                patients’ minds, which cause contradictions between them.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Medical dispute cases emerge after incidents happen and patients usually
                                have two solutions, legal approach, and compounding. &nbsp;</b>

                            <b>The number of medical disputes cases recorded in
                                <a href="https://www.chinacourt.org/index.shtml">Chinacourt</a>&nbsp;rose from 24 in 2009 to 3511 in 2019, which is 146 times larger
                                than that in 10 years ago. Although in recent 4 years, the number does
                                not see a noticeable increase, the difference in the level of magnitude
                                still shows a dangerous signal.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>“That may be related to the ever-increasing legal awareness of people,
                                but the conflicts&nbsp;between doctors and patients is the main reason.”&nbsp;

                                <br>Compounding is the other way for patients and their families to ask for
                                compensation from hospitals. Li Bo, a sociologist&nbsp;studying mediation
                                systems for medical disputes, states that patients who are in poor conditions
                                are more likely to adopt compounding as their solutions since legal proceedings
                                always require high costs of time and money.&nbsp;

                                indicates a noticeable issue that the doctor-patient relationship in China
                                is stuck in a dilemma.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>The doctor-patient relationship plays a vital role in health care practices
                                and is a crucial part of the&nbsp;foundations of contemporary medical ethics.&nbsp;

                                resources, China does not achieve a satisfying standard overall.
                                <br>
                                <br>In China, per 1000 people have 1.8 physicians on average, which is slightly
                                higher than the world’s average (1.5) and the average of East Asia (1.6)
                                but lower than most developed countries in Europe, North America, and Australia.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>As for nurses and midwives, the average holding quantity is 2.3 for Chinese
                                people, while the average of the world is 3.4, which is 1.5 times larger
                                than that of China.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>A doctor who works in a 3A hospital describes one day of her work as follows.
                                She always arrives at the hospital she works in at 7:30 am or even earlier
                                although the ruled time is 8 am. Even though she should have rested on
                                weekends and holidays except for being on duty, she still needs to arrive
                                at the hospital on time, not to mention when she will come off duty. “There
                                have always been patients and their relatives who will get angry if they
                                cannot find me after my working hours.”&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>That is the situation faced by most health workers, especially those who
                                work in big hospitals.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Another problem is the excessive centralization of patients in metropolis
                                and grade A class 3 hospital. According to the statistics of Chinese authority,
                                49.8% of clinics are treated in hospitals of the highest class.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>These hospitals possess richer medical resources and more experienced
                                medical experts, compared to those small hospitals. As a result, patients
                                are willing to turn to these hospitals for better treatment, which leads
                                to a consequence of medical resource shortage in advanced hospitals while
                                the small hospitals have few patients at the same time.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>As shown by the statistics of Chinacourt, Beijing has received the second
                                large number of medical dispute cases, which follows right after Henan
                                (the province that has the largest population). Guangzhou, another province
                                with rich medical resources, reaches 1136 cases, either.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>The centralization of patients causes an over-occupation in the advanced
                                hospitals, hence medical disputes emerge. The relationship between medical
                                workers and patients comes up in society.&nbsp;

                            <b>Since 1949, China has been executing different forms of health care systems,
                                which varied from universal health care under communism to the market-oriented
                                systems since 1984.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>A distinguishing feature of the healthcare system that formed in this
                                period&nbsp;was drug price addition policy. Since 90% of medical resources
                                were owned by public hospitals, they have the right of manipulating the
                                whole market to some extent.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Millions of people&nbsp;were left in the reform without insurance coverage,
                                while the delivery of medical services earns the maximum profit. Dr. David
                                Bluementhal, the president of The Commonwealth Fund who conducts research
                                on health care issues around the world, states that this creates a damaging
                                cycle in which patients become vulnerable and suspicious about doctors’
                                motives. The crisis of confidence between doctors and patients emerges
                                then.&nbsp;

                                <br>As regulated by the government, hospitals should provide patients with
                                the&nbsp;cost prices of the treatment. However, most hospitals cannot maintain
                                their operation under this policy. Hence, they are allowed to rise by 15%
                                to 20% of the market price of the drugs and sell them to patients. Under
                                this circumstance, many hospitals gain profit by selling additional and
                                unnecessary drugs to patients.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>In&nbsp;2007, medical scholars, Zhang Guizhi, Dong Zhaoju &amp; Wang Jingyan,
                                pointed out in their research paper that the root of conflicts between
                                doctors and patients was the inappropriate health care system.&nbsp;

                                <br>Ever since 2009, the government implemented a new round&nbsp;of medical
                                system reform, which aimed to make it possible for the public to receive
                                affordable health care services by 2020. Policies are designed to reduce
                                the cost of medical treatment for patients through the new medical system
                                reform.&nbsp;

                                <br>However, the implementation seems not to be effective in improving the

                                medical help, just like drivers can be easily irritated when driving a
                                car. Irritable patients become the potential dangers of violent accidents.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Wang Xinjian analyzes the reasons for the crisis of confidence between
                                patients and medical workers from the&nbsp;angle of attribution of responsibility.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Wang says that China has experienced a long period of social transformation
                                after the reform and opening-up policy.&nbsp;Under this circumstance, traditional
                                social values are shocked, which weakens the power of the existing social
                                regulations and the value system. Hence, the social crisis of confidence
                                comes after the reform. The relationship between doctors and patients is
                                just a part of what has been influenced.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Some scholars (Wang Ru, Wang Zhaoliang) point out that the root of violence
                                against doctors is the unavoidable&nbsp;social contradiction during the
                                period of social transformation.&nbsp;

                                <br>In addition, the specialty of the healthcare industry intensifies the
                                tension, since some&nbsp;outcomes of medical treatment are unpredictable
                                and irredeemable. As a result, during the process of treatment, each step
                                should be taken carefully, or the vulnerable confidence relationship will
                                be damaged.&nbsp;

                                <br>Public ownership of social resources is a remarkable symbol of the era
                                that Mao Zedong is in&nbsp;power. The salary of doctors is paid by the
                                state on a monthly basis, and the benefits are paid by the state finance.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>The salary is slightly higher than the staff of the&nbsp;government (now
                                civil servants), and the salary of the chief physician is equivalent to
                                the level of the national cadres at the deputy department level. Doctors
                                are only responsible for medical treatment and patients. The financial
                                staff is responsible for collecting medical expenses. Hospital finance
                                implements two lines of revenue and expenditure.&nbsp;

                                burden to patients. Some doctors bear much working amount and pressure,

                                doctors and patients, insurance companies would pay for compensation for
                                all satisfactory patients without judging responsibilities and fault. The

                                to statistics, 52% of doctors think that their benefits are sacrificed
                                during the mediation system.&nbsp;

                                <br>When dealing with realistic disputes, a team formed by lawyers and doctors
                                will give advice to&nbsp;people involved in the accident about the form
                                and amount of compensation after discussing and researching the case’s
                                details.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>The mediation system in Germany has three&nbsp;principles. Firstly, parties
                                in action have the right to choose whether to accept mediation or not.
                                Secondly, they only give advice without constraint in law. Thirdly, the
                                mediation expense should be free so that it can encourage more people to
                                choose this approach.&nbsp;

                                <br>The Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) has been valued highly in recent
                                years in&nbsp;Taiwan. As the number of medical disputes authentication
                                cases grows to 547 in 2011, which is 3.77 times larger than 145 in 1987,
                                the ADR has received more attention than before and it is valued for its
                                effectiveness.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>The idea of ADR is to use different approaches like conciliation, mediation,
                                and arbitration&nbsp;to replace litigation, which can reduce the cost of
                                time and money for both medical staff and patients in a way that is less
                                aggressive.&nbsp;

                                <br>Rita Charon, a clinical medicine professor at&nbsp;the University of Columbia,
                                put forward the term “narrative medicine” in 2001, which emphasizes the
                                importance of doctors’ understanding of patients’ pain and lifts biological
                                medicine to a spiritual level.&nbsp;

                                <br>She holds the&nbsp;opinion that complicated contemporary medicine is distant
                                and indifferent. The improvement of the medical technique sacrifices the
                                relationship between doctors and patients. Doctors seem not to have enough
                                time and empathy to understand the sufferings of patients, which is required
                                for patients indeed.&nbsp;

                                with defensive medical treatment, and puts pressure on legislators to limit

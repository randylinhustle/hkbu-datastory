						<p>Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen stressed the future cooperative plans with the South and
							Southeast Asian countries in a speech right after she won a second term in January despite
							criticism that her New Southbound Policy (NSP) lacks clear goals and the scale is relatively
							small in terms of trade.</p>

						<p>In her victory speech, Ms Tsai from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) known for its
							pro-independence stance failed to mention about the island’s economic relations with China,
							which runs counter to Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Han Kuo-yu’s pro-China policy of “sells
							goods, welcome people”.</p>

						<p>Ms Tsai said Taiwan is a member of the Indo-Pacific region and will continue to participate
							and cooperate in advancing the wellbeing of the region, including the promotion of the NSP.

						<p>Taiwan will be willing to assist in all aspects of education, culture, health care, science
							and technology, she said. The moves followed Tsai’s NSP launched in 2016 to re-diversify
							Taiwan’s trade portfolio from China by fostering cooperation with 10 ASEAN countries, six
							countries in South Asia and Australia and New Zealand.</p>

						<p>“Tsai Ing-wen should promote the New Southbound Policy after re-elected, but it raises the
							question of whether she can achieve the goals for the policy in the future,” Tsai Hung-jeng,
							a professor of social studies at the National Sun Yat-sen University, said before the
							election. Professor Tsai is also the director of the Center of Southeast Asian studies of
							the university.</p>


						<p>Everything related to Southeast Asia would be called NSP projects. Hence, it was hard to
							determine whether those projects could reach the ultimate purpose of the policy, said
							professor Tsai. "Every department worked on those projects, but the ends of policy were
							changed frequently, which is equivalent to no goal for the policy."</p>

						<h2>Southbound policy from past to now</h2>
						<p>The NSP, which covers 18 countries, is a renewed push by the DPP government to lower Taiwan’s
							dependency on China who accounted for more than 30 per cent of the island’s total trade in
							the first 10 months of 2019.</p>

						<p>The predecessor of the NSP called the Southern Policy was a foreign and economic policy
							implemented in the 1990s to promote the transfer of overseas investments by Taiwanese to
							Southeast Asia. However, it gradually failed as China strengthened its Economic Reform and
							Open Up policy, creating a cluster effect which attracted investors from Taiwan.</p>

						<p>Johnny Lin, 42, a spokesperson of the DPP, said the significant difference between the New
							Southbound Policy and the former one is that the development of trade relationships is only
							part of the plan. The NSP would not only focus on developing the economic side because that
							would be hard to maintain a long-term and stable cooperative relationship with these
							countries.</p>

						<p>People’s integration is also important. “Foreign language is an essential bridge for
							communicating with the outside world so that we view education as an important part of the
							policy,” Mr Lin said. “A large number of Vietnamese brides married to Taiwanese decades ago,
							and we encourage their offspring to learn the native language of their mothers.”</p>

						<h2>Early fruits from the NSP</h2>
						<p>Helped by the NSP, the number of travellers from the 18 countries to Taiwan rose about
							one-quarter to more than 2.5 million in 2019 from about 2 million in 2016. Besides, the gap
							between the number of tourists visiting Taiwan between China and the NSP countries has
							become smaller year by year.</p>

						</div>

						<p>The value of trade between Taiwan and the NSP countries rose about 22 per cent from US$96.01
							billion in 2016 to US$116.7 billion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Foreign Trade. Total
							trade of these countries accounted for about 18 per cent of the island’s total import and
							export value in the first 10 months of 2019.</p>

						<p>Lai Wei-hsin, the president of Asia Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, who has been doing
							business with Indonesia for many years, said that Taiwanese companies did not have enough
							understanding of the Southeast-Asia region at the beginning. However, after the
							implementation of the NSP, plenty of labours and tourists from Southeast-Asian countries
							visited Taiwan. Taiwanese companies also launched more projects and investments to
							Southeast-Asia countries.</p>

						<p>"The culture exchanges between Taiwan and other cooperating countries have greatly improved
							compared to the past, which was beneficial for economic development," Mr Lai added.</p>

						<p>The future development of the NSP and the execution of the policy will be vital to Taiwan as
							it seeks to lessen China’s influence on the island and cope with the ongoing US-China trade
							war.</p>

						<h2>China market remains vital</h2>
						<p>Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu has been unenthusiastic about deploying large-scale resources to
							expand ties with Southeast Asian countries, having criticized many times that these efforts
							have not brought mutual benefits to Taiwan.</p>

						<p>“It’s unreasonable for DPP not to focus on maintaining the Chinese market but to develop
							Southeast Asian markets,” said Qiang Qiang Gun, a pro-Han Kuo-yu YouTuber in Kaohsiung.
							“Government investment should prioritize the country closest to it, and China is the best
							target which has the same culture and language as us,” he said.</p>

						<h2>NSP has ambiguous goals?</h2>
						<p>Professor Tsai Hung-jeng said many Taiwanese businessmen had left China to Southeast Asian
							countries since 2010 and the Tsai government should beef up the promotion of the New
							Southbound Policy.</p>

						<p>Taiwan’s investment to China hit a record of US$14.38 billion in 2010 while it fell more than
							40 per cent to a low of US$8.5 billion in 2018, data from the Investment Commission of the
							Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEAIC) showed. The investment slipped further to US$3.7
							billion in the first 10 months of 2019 due to the continued impact of the U.S.-China trade
							war.</p>

						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/2455673"
							data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2455673/embed">
							<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
						</div>

						<p>It is difficult to determine whether Taiwan's Economic Policy towards Southeast Asia is
							successful at this stage because its goal is ambiguous, professor Tsai said. Taiwan’s
							overall export to the 18 New Southbound countries declined 7.37 per cent, and imports eased
							0.26 per cent, from January to November in 2019.</p>

						<p>However, Mr Lai did not agree that the goals for the policy were confused and said that the
							goals for NSP were clear which focused on ‘people-oriented approach and aiming to foster
							bilateral exchange and mutual resources sharing’ between Taiwan and 18 New Southbound
							countries.</p>

							<h2>Next step of Taiwan’s economy</h2>
							<p>Further, Mr Lai believes that the relationship in economics and trades between China and
								Taiwan will not be intensified after Tsai continues in office. “People may think that if
								the relationship of trade between China and Taiwan worsen, it may damage the development
								of Taiwan’s economy. The argument does not make sense from my point of view.”</p>

							<p>He explained that Taiwan’s economy did not depend on China business only. There was less
								business between China and Taiwan, while Taiwan had closer business cooperation with the
								United States. Thus, the development of Taiwan’s economy will not be determined only by
								the relations between China and Taiwan.</p>

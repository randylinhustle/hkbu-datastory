    <p class="my-3 head"> Ada, 20- year- old, is the mother of two children. She dropped out of school when she was 18 because of an unexpected
    pregnancy. "My menstruation had just ended and I thought it was safe to have sex at that moment. So, I did not take
    contraceptive measures. When I did not have menstruation over a month and I realized that I was pregnant, I was very scared,"
    she says.</p>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> Unintended pregnancy is a pregnancy that is either unwanted, such as the pregnancy occurred when no children or no more
  children were desired. Or the pregnancy is mistimed, such as the pregnancy occurred earlier than desired.</p>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> Bain & Company, an international consultancy, conservatively estimates that most of the 7,000 unintended pregnancies in
  Hong Kong each year are single girls under the age of 25.</p>
</div>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> According to The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong (FPAHK), an organization that focuses on young women with
  unwanted pregnancies. The number of new clients under the age of 25 who seek emergency contraceptive services overall
  increasing from 2014 to 2018.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
<img src="assets/images/w1.png" alt="" id="img">
  </div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> Emergency contraception is a way of preventing pregnancy. The increasing of number of new patients under the age of 25
  who seek emergency contraceptive services is reflecting the lack of sexual knowledge and protective households among the
  younger generation of women. If the female had sex without using contraception, missed pills, or if had a contraceptive
  accident such as a broken or slipped condom, FPAHK will provide emergency contraception services. For example, give them
  emergency contraceptive pills or help them copper "T" intra-uterine device.</p>
</div>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> The situation of young women had sex without using contraception seems more serious during the covid-19 pandemic. Other data also
  from FPAHK, shows the number of attendances of unmarried women aged below 26 for seeking termination of pregnancy and
  emergency contraception in first eight months of this year is up from the previous year.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <img src="assets/images/w2.png">
</div>



<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> According to FPAH, this could probably be explained by the reduction in related services in both public and private
  health sectors, leaving FPAHK their only option.In fact, other organizations also received more request for help about
  unwanted pregnancies. Mother's Choice, an organization that assists girls with unwanted pregnancies, received the number of calls for help increased by 80% in April.The non-profit organization Teenâ€™s Key also received the
  doubled number of requests in recent months.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> According to the figures of the Hospital Authority, among the approximately 40,000 birth cases each year, about 1,000
  cases of teenage pregnancy are under the age of 18, and there have been cases of student pregnancy in many schools. The
  situation is similar to Ada.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> However, among these young women with unwanted pregnancies, not all of them choose to give birth to their children, some women 
  choose to have abortions.
</p>
</div>



<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> <strong>The Legal abortion</strong></p>
</div>



<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> Based on some figures provided by the government, we can understand the situation of legal abortion in Hong Kong.
  According to figures from the Department of Health, the number of legal terminations in Hong Kong in 2015 was 9,890.
  According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, the number of babies born in the same year was 59,878. When
  we compare the two numbers, you will have the information that about one out of seven pregnant women will have a legal
  abortion.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> In section 47A of the Offences Against the Person Ordinance, Chapter 212 of the Laws of Hong Kong, stipulates that
  pregnant women within 24 weeks can terminate their pregnancy with the consent of two registered doctors If the pregnancy
  continues will be dangerous to the life of pregnant woman, or the risk of harm to her body or spirit, which is greater
  than the termination of the pregnancy, or after the baby is born.</p>
</div>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> Apart from it, If the pregnant woman is under the age of 16, or she becomes pregnant due to sexual crimes such as
  incest, rape, the pregnancy can also be legally terminated. However, if a pregnant woman has been pregnant for more than
  24 weeks, the doctor can only terminate the pregnancy on the premise of saving her life.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> In 2018, there were more than 8,000 cases of legal termination of pregnancy in Hong Kong. According to the data from the
  FPAHK shows that the number of new clients who under 26 seeking to terminate abortions from 2014 to 2018 has declined
  year by year.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <img src="assets/images/w3.png">
</div>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> In fact, there are also cases of abortion in other places or illegal abortions. To avoid these problems, the most
  important thing is sex education for the next generation.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head"> <strong>How the effectiveness of sex education in Hong Kong?</strong></p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head">The Guidelines on Sex Education in Schools of Hong Kong were published in 1997 and have not been updated after 23 years.
  The Education Bureau reformed the curriculum in 2000, sex education has been incorporated into the various learning
  areas of primary and secondary schools and the curriculum of moral education and civic education, but it is difficult
  for the public to know whether and how the school implements sex education.</p>
</div>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head">The Youth Sexuality Study (YSS) has been conducted by The FPAHK every five years since 1981 and monitors changing trends
  in local youngstersâ€™ knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to sexuality. In the most recent survey conducted in
  2016, the FPAHK polled a total of 5,146 youths: 3,907 secondary school students from Form One to Form Six, and 1,239
  youths aged between 18 and 27 in a household survey. The Report on Youth Sexuality Study 2016 which revealed youthsâ€™
  declining sexual knowledge.</p>
</div>


<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head">Form 3 to Form 6 students scored an average of 8 correct answers out of 12 key questions about conception, sexually transmissible
  infections (STI) and HIV/AIDS in 2016, down from 9 in 2011. The average score of F.1-F.2 students, already
  unsatisfactory at 6 in 2011, further dropped to 5 in 2016.</p>
</div>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <img src="assets/images/w4.png">
</div>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head">The survey report conducted by the Youth Development Commission in 2016 show in the Website of FPAHK point out that 40%
  of the interviewed who aged between 12 and 24 agreed that their knowledge of sex was shortage, 77% said they had never
  talked about sex with their parents, and more than 40% said their source of sex knowledge was mainly pornographic
  videos. The lack of adequate sex education in Hong Kong has a profound impact on the number of unintended pregnancies
  among teenage girls.</p>
</div>

<div class="heading text-align:justify mx-auto">
  <p class="my-3 head">
  "Both school and parents do not talk about this topic in-depth, many times I use Google to search for sexual
  knowledge." Ada said. She believes she will teach her children about sex knowledge in the future, and hopes that the school can give more
  resources to sex education.

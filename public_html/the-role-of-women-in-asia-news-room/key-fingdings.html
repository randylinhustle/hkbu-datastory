				<p>Research has documented the dimensions of the problem, in particular, a longitudinal study launched
					by the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) in 1995 comparing participation in the news industry
					globally by men and women based on the published bylines of stories. </p>

				<p>The data have been collected at five-year intervals, with 114 countries participating in 2015. The
					findings indicated that female reporters wrote an average of only 37% of the published stories in
					that yearâ€”though this number did represent an increase of 9% over the finding in the first year of
					the study that women wrote 28% of stories. </p>

				<p>More specifically, women in 2015 reported 41% of the stories on the radio, 38% of those on
					television, and 35% of those in newspapers; thus, women were most underrepresented in newspapers.
				</p>

				<p>The situation is even worse in Asia. Thus, a recent IMWF report found that
					only 20.7% of news industry workers in Asia and Oceania were female and that women
					occupied just 9.2% of top management positions. </p>

				</div>

				<p>Data from the Worlds of Journalism indicate, not surprisingly, that a strong correlation exists
					between the proportion of women working in journalism and the proportion of women in top editorial
					positions. Correlation does not, of course, necessarily entail causation, but it seems clear that
					national markets in which a relatively large proportion of women are working in journalism also tend
					to be characterized by relatively large numbers of women in top editorial positions. </p>

				<p>Nevertheless, in nine of the ten markets represented in the data, a significantly larger proportion
					of women were working as journalists than the proportion of women employed as top editors.</p>

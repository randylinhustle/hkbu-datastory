					Hundred” amounts to 2.4 times as high as that of “Ne Zha” last year. Part of the reasons behind the
					popularity of “The Eight Hundred” could be the psychological effect of revenge spending after a long

					China’s Summer Movie Season (暑期档) starts from June 1st and ends on August 31. This chart compares
					box office performances from 2017 to 2020 to give a complete picture of cinemas’ operating
					conditions after the reopening on July 20.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Firstly, the total movie attendance during the Summer Movie Season this year dropped dramatically to
					100 million people from around 500 million in 2019. The gap corresponds with the decline of total
					box office from about 17.653 million to 3.609 million. However, as there were only 43 days in this
					year’s Summer Movie Season and a below 30 percent attendance rate is regulated by cinemas, this
					figure was already imposing.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Moreover, 86 percent of the total box office this year was contributed by the most popular film,
					“The Eight Hundred.” This proportion was much larger than that in the previous three years, 26
					percent, 22 percent and 31 percent respectively. The box office performance of “The Eight Hundred”
					was satisfactory compared with the most popular films in the last three years, suggesting that the
					most popular movie’s box office performances during the summer movie season continued to be stable
					despite the pandemic.

					The lunar New Year, Summer Vacation, and the 7-day Chinese national holidays [also known as Golden
					Week] are the three most essential movie seasons for cinemas. The box office of Chinese cinemas in
					these three vacations kept hitting new records every year before 2019. However, it hit rock bottom
					in 2020.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					The box office during the 2018 and 2019 Lunar New Year was nearly RMB 6 billion. High expectations
					were put to the box office of the films scheduled to be released in the 2020 Chinese new year. For
					example, Detective Chinatown 3, a sequel of Detective Chinatown 2, which earned RMB 3.4 billion in
					2019, was one of those movies in the spotlight. However, due to the pandemic, cinemas closed before
					the release of these films and the domestic box office in the 2020 Chinese New year was zero.
					Likewise, the Summer Vacation box office also saw a significant drop.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Fortunately, since cinemas reopened on July 20 [about two months before the Golden Week holiday],
					the market has recovered quickly. The 2020 Golden Week’s box office was close to RMB 4 billion,
					slightly below last year’s 4.47 billion, but more than double that of 2018.

				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					If sorting these films by revenue and location, it is suggested that cinemas from mainland China
					make up the majority of the world’s box office. More than half of the 30 films are from mainland
					China, followed by the US and Hong Kong. Unlike in 2020, 2019’s mainland Chinese films were not so
					popular. Only 40 percent of the top 30 films were from mainland China last year and the US took up
					33.3 percent, followed by 16.7 percent of Hong Kong films.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Furthermore, changing the above-interacted graph to a line graph section and sorting the films by

					the animation is the most frequent genre. Compared with 2019, there is a significant growth in

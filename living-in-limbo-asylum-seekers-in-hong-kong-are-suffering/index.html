				<p class="lead">From the archway of Lo Uk Village in Yuen Long, follow the path to a rural house,
					pick up the stairs to the second floor, and walk into a 500-foot flat. This is the apartment Tariq
					Mehmood Raja shares with three asylum seekers, and it also serves as the office of the <a
						href="https://www.facebook.com/HKSASR/"><span><u>Hong Kong
								Society for Asylum-seekers and Refugees</u></span></a> (HKSASR).</p>

				<p class="lead">Sitting on a grimy armchair, Raja, the head of the Society, describes an asylum seeker's
					life in Hong Kong, where the long wait not only drains youth but also destroys will and hope. "We
					come here without any work, never having anything to do but stay at home and stare blankly, day
					after day,
					year after year," Raja stated.</p>

				<p class="lead">"Many asylum seekers are intellectuals in their own countries - doctors, lawyers,
					businessmen, teachers - they never come to Hong Kong for the money," continued Raja, "losing out on
					their reputations, properties, families, careers, just to stay alive."</p>

				</p>

				<p class="lead">This Pakistani fugitive from political persecution has been stranded in Hong Kong for 13
					years, from 29 to 42, until his claim for Non-refoulement Protection was confirmed in 2015, pending
					recognition of his <a
						href="https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-status-determination.html"><span><u>refugee
								status</u></span></a> by the United Nations. Even though more than a decade has been
					exhausted, a loss that can never be restored, Raja has yet to receive formal status.</p>

				<h1>Stranded in the Midway</h1>

				<p class="lead">"Please don't waste our time! The most precious time of our lives is spent on these
					pointless waits!" Raja said agitatedly, "the people sitting in the Legislative Council or at the
					Immigration Department are talking nonsense, and they don't really understand what it's like to be
					an asylum seeker."</p>

				<p class="lead">Hong Kong is not a refugee resettlement city as it is not a signatory to the <a
						href="https://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html"><span><u>United
								Nationsâ€™ Refugee Convention</u></span></a>, but the government is obliged to screen
					torture and persecution claims. If a claimant is recognized, he or she will be sent to a third
					country by
					the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/resettlement.html"><span><u>United Nations High
								Commissioner for Refugees</u></span></a> (UNHCR), and ultimately Hong Kong will not have
					to accept these people. In
					other words, the city was never their destination, merely a "stopover."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">The only way to seek asylum is by filing the <a
						href="https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/useful_information/non-refoulement-making-claim.html"><span><u>Non-refoulement
								Protection</u></span></a>,
					and the average processing time for each claim is about ten weeks, according to a March 2019
					<a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr18-19/english/hc/papers/hc20190301cb2-874-e.pdf"><span><u>Legislative
								Council document</u></span></a>. If the Immigration Department rejects a claim, the
					individual can appeal to the Torture Claims Appeals Board, then the Court of Appeal and the Court of
					Final Appeal.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Nonetheless, the request has a roughly 1 percent
					substantiation rate based on the <a
						href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202005/20/P2020052000649.htm?fontSize=1"><span><u>latest
								figures</u></span></a>, significantly lower than the global average of 30 percent and
					European average
					of 60 percent, which means non-stop appeals will be needed. Immigration Department statistics show
					that between 2009 and April 2020, only 231 out of
					22,737 claims were successful.</p>

				<p class="lead">Raja said that he had conversed with several officials, but none of them realized the
					seriousness of the situation."We are dying in another way, and they are depriving us of our right to
					start lives over," Raja said desperately, "at first we all thought we would leave Hong Kong in a few
					months."</p>

				<h1>New Mechanism Lacks Humanitarian Spirit</h1>

				<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/656059">

				</div>

				<p class="lead">As of October 2020, the majority of pending Non-refoulement Protection applicants are
					from Southeast Asian countries, with the largest number coming from Vietnam, contributing
					approximately 34 percent. Moreover, 49 percent of the claimants' status in Hong Kong are illegal
					immigrants, while 35 percent are overstayers, according to the <a
						href="https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/facts/enforcement.html"><span><u>Hong Kong Immigration
								Department</u></span></a>.
				</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4471811">
					<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">Since 2014, when the Hong Kong government launched the <a
						href="https://www.immd.gov.hk/pdf/non-refoulement_claim_flow_chart.pdf"><span><u>Unified
								Screening Mechanism</u></span></a>, or
					USM, the cumulative number of pending Non-refoulement Protection has dropped from 9,618 to 266 in
					five years. In 2018 alone, the Immigration Department determined more than 5,400 cases.</p>

				<p class="lead">"The Immigration Department has been blindly improving its efficiency, but they
					neglected to deal with it humanely," said Dr. Isabella Ng Fung-sheung, Assistant Professor and
					Associate Head of the Department of Asian and Policy Studies at The Education University of Hong
					Kong. With the new mechanism implemented by the government, she said, it is true that "the earliest
					application can be granted within two years, thanks to additional staffing."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Dr. Ng questioned the vetting staff did not have adequate English skills and lacked
					knowledge of the applicant's background, sometimes even making spelling mistakes. "The
					responsibility for such a poor substantiation rate lies with us [the Hong Kong government], not with
					them [the claimants]," she said.

				</p>

				<p class="lead">"If the request for Non-refoulement Protection is rejected, asylum seekers have only 14
					days to appeal, but it takes one or two days for the notification letter to reach them, plus they
					have to find someone else to translate and prepare the relevant documents," Dr. Ng added, "most of
					them don't have any acquaintances in Hong Kong, so two weeks is an insufficient amount of time."

				<p class="lead">A sample of the 28-sided <a
						href="https://www.immd.gov.hk/pdforms/Non-refoulement%20Claim%20Form.pdf"><span><u>Non-refoulement
								Claim form</u></span></a> available at the Immigration
					Department website is one of the difficulties faced by numerous asylum seekers who are unable to
					read this voluminous document and have to enlist the aid of relevant NGOs.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Raja confirmed Dr. Ngâ€™s illustration. He cited the example of an asylum seeker
					from Pakistan who was altered by staff to be from India because of the "hearsay" process of
					translating the document. Raja said, "there is a chance that the applicant's version of the story,
					after multiple translations, can be very different, which ultimately affects the outcome."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Raja has many fellows who have waited 8 or 9 years for their cases to be heard, and
					every time they are confronted with memories of persecution, abuse, and even mental illness from the
					anxiety of waiting indefinitely and the shadow of past trauma.

				</p>

				<p class="lead">"In every screening interview, the Immigration Department staff would ask the same
					questions over and over again, such as the country you came from, the persecution you suffered, and
					if there were a slight discrepancy in your testimony, they would begin to challenge you, saying that
					there were inconsistencies," stated Raja. He wondered, "why interrogate us vulnerable people in a
					way that assumes we are criminals?"
				</p>

				<h1>Struggling to make ends meet, asylum seekers are unable to support themselves</h1>

				<p class="lead">Born into a Navy family, Raja was well-to-do in his homeland, running his own real
					estate business and owning an office in his early twenties, living a middle-class lifestyle with his
					wife. Then, after all that good fortune turned to illusion, he fell into a more bottomless abyss -
					the deprivation of his right to work.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"I felt useless. I lost my dignity," said Raja. "If I commit a crime and you condemn me
					to such a long term of imprisonment, you know after that year Iâ€™ll be free, but in this instance,
					you did not know how long before you are set free."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Asylum seekers in Hong Kong are not allowed to work while their claims are being
					processed, and offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of HK$50,000 and up to three
					yearsâ€™ imprisonment.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">The government only subsidizes them with HK$1,500 a month for housing, HK$1,200 in
					prepaid supermarket vouchers, HK$300 for utilities, and HK$200 for transport. These subsidies have
					been the same for more than six years, and the scant amount provided has only made the financial
					burdens of the pandemic weigh heavier on them.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"A package of chicken used to cost HK$34, but now HK$40," said Zima, 30, who was waiting
					for the results of the application, sat on the stone steps to pass the time, complaining that life
					was getting harder than ever.
				</p>

				</p>

				<p class="lead">"We live here worse than dogs," Zima supplemented, "I cannot believe that a city so rich
					offers so little to those who come to it looking for help."
				</p>

				<p class="lead">Swadiq Khan, the owner of a chain of "cha chaan teng" that has donated food several
					times without compensation, said asylum seekers are able-bodied but have no opportunity to earn
					their own living, even though there are many arduous posts that are unfilled. "Without a job, they
					can easily develop a negative energy and may take up illegal jobs, or even be exploited by
					criminals," he said.
				</p>

				</p>

				<p class="lead">"This is a bunch of people who are living in limbo, being ignored," said Khan, "but I
					believe in natural rights and they have the authority to highlight their worth." Because of his
					Chinese-Pakistani identity, Khan was subjected to innumerable forms of discrimination as a child,
					and therefore he knows that peer-to-peer is not easy to come by.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">"I'll do what the government won't do, and I'll help those the government won't help,"
					Khan added.
